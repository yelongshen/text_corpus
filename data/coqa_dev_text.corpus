Once upon a time, in a barn near a farm house, there lived a little white kitten named Cotton. Cotton lived high up in a nice warm place above the barn where all of the farmer's horses slept. But Cotton wasn't alone in her little home above the barn, oh no. She shared her hay bed with her mommy and 5 other sisters. All of her sisters were cute and fluffy, like Cotton. But she was the only white one in the bunch. The rest of her sisters were all orange with beautiful white tiger stripes like Cotton's mommy. Being different made Cotton quite sad. She often wished she looked like the rest of her family. So one day, when Cotton found a can of the old farmer's orange paint, she used it to paint herself like them. When her mommy and sisters found her they started laughing. 

"What are you doing, Cotton?!" 

"I only wanted to be more like you". 

Cotton's mommy rubbed her face on Cotton's and said "Oh Cotton, but your fur is so pretty and special, like you. We would never want you to be any other way". And with that, Cotton's mommy picked her up and dropped her into a big bucket of water. When Cotton came out she was herself again. Her sisters licked her face until Cotton's fur was all all dry. 

"Don't ever do that again, Cotton!" they all cried. "Next time you might mess up that pretty white fur of yours and we wouldn't want that!" 

Then Cotton thought, "I change my mind. I like being special". [Q:] What color was Cotton? [A:] white  [Q:] Where did she live? [A:] in a barn  [Q:] Did she live alone?

Once there was a beautiful fish named Asta. Asta lived in the ocean. There were lots of other fish in the ocean where Asta lived. They played all day long. 

One day, a bottle floated by over the heads of Asta and his friends. They looked up and saw the bottle. "What is it?" said Asta's friend Sharkie. "It looks like a bird's belly," said Asta. But when they swam closer, it was not a bird's belly. It was hard and clear, and there was something inside it. 

The bottle floated above them. They wanted to open it. They wanted to see what was inside. So they caught the bottle and carried it down to the bottom of the ocean. They cracked it open on a rock. When they got it open, they found what was inside. It was a note. The note was written in orange crayon on white paper. Asta could not read the note. Sharkie could not read the note. They took the note to Asta's papa. "What does it say?" they asked. 

Asta's papa read the note. He told Asta and Sharkie, "This note is from a little girl. She wants to be your friend. If you want to be her friend, we can write a note to her. But you have to find another bottle so we can send it to her." And that is what they did. [Q:] what was the name of the fish [A:] Asta.

My doorbell rings. On the step, I find the elderly Chinese lady, small and slight, holding the hand of a little boy. In her other hand, she holds a paper carrier bag. 

I know this lady. It is not her first visit. She is the boy's grandmother, and her daughter bought the house next door last October. 

Her daughter, Nicole, speaks fluent English. But she is now in Shanghai, and her parents are here with the little boy. Nicole has obviously told her mother that I am having heart surgery soon, so her mother has decided I need more nutrients. 

I know what is inside the bag--a thermos with hot soup and a stainless-steel container with rice, vegetables and either chicken, meat or shrimp, sometimes with a kind of pancake. This has become an almost-daily practice. 

Communication between us is somewhat affected by the fact that she doesn't speak English and all I can say in Chinese is hello. Once, she brought an iPad as well as the food. She pointed to the screen, which displayed a message from her daughter telling me that her mother wanted to know if the food was all right and whether it was too salty. I am not used to iPads, so she indicated I should go with her to her house. Then, she handed the iPad to her husband and almost immediately I found myself looking at Nicole in Shanghai and discussing her mother's cooking and salt intake. Instantly, tears welled in my eyes. 

"Your mother just can't be bringing me meals like this all the time," I insisted. "I can hardly do dishes in return." 

"Oh, no, Lucy." Nicole said. "Mum doesn't like western food. Don't worry about it; she has to cook for the three of them anyway, and she wants to do it." 

The doorbell keeps ringing and there is the familiar brown paper carrier bag, handed smilingly to me. 

I am now working on some more Chinese words--it's the least I can do after such display of kindness. 

"Thank you" is, of course, the first one. Somehow, it seems inadequate. [Q:] Who is at the door? [A:] An elderly Chinese lady and a little boy  [Q:] Is she carrying something? [A:] Yes  [Q:] What? [A:] a paper carrier bag  [Q:] Do I know her? [A:] Yes  [Q:] Who is her daughter? [A:] Nicole  [Q:] Where does Nicole live? [A:] Shanghai  [Q:] How is she related to the boy? [A:] mother  [Q:] What is in the bag? [A:] food  [Q:] Has she done this before? [A:] Yes  [Q:] Why? [A:] I am having heart surgery soon, so her mother has decided I need more nutrients  [Q:] What has helped us communicate? [A:] an iPad  [Q:] What kind of dishes does she bring? [A:] hot soup and a container with rice, vegetables and either chicken, meat or shrimp, sometimes with a kind of pancake  [Q:] What do I do to help communicate with her? [A:] I am now working on some more Chinese words  [Q:] Do she continue bringing the bag? [A:] Yes  [Q:] What is the first phrase I learn? [A:] "Thank you"
(CNN) -- Dennis Farina, the dapper, mustachioed cop-turned-actor best known for his tough-as-nails work in such TV series as "Law & Order," "Crime Story," and "Miami Vice," has died. He was 69. 

"We are deeply saddened by the loss of a great actor and a wonderful man," said his publicist, Lori De Waal, in a statement Monday. "Dennis Farina was always warmhearted and professional, with a great sense of humor and passion for his profession. He will be greatly missed by his family, friends and colleagues." 

Farina, who had a long career as a police officer in Chicago, got into acting through director Michael Mann, who used him as a consultant and cast him in his 1981 movie, "Thief." That role led to others in such Mann-created shows as "Miami Vice" (in which Farina played a mobster) and "Crime Story" (in which he starred as Lt. Mike Torello). 

Farina also had roles, generally as either cops or gangsters, in a number of movies, including "Midnight Run" (1988), "Get Shorty" (1995), "The Mod Squad" (1999) and "Snatch" (2000). 

In 2004, he joined the cast of the long-running "Law & Order" after Jerry Orbach's departure, playing Detective Joe Fontana, a role he reprised on the spinoff "Trial by Jury." Fontana was known for flashy clothes and an expensive car, a distinct counterpoint to Orbach's rumpled Lennie Briscoe. 

Farina was on "Law & Order" for two years, partnered with Jesse L. Martin's Ed Green. Martin's character became a senior detective after Farina left the show.  [Q:] Is someone in showbiz? [A:] Yes.

Thunder was coming when Reginald Eppes woke up at five in the morning. He checked the weather forecast. A violent storm was coming ,but it sounded like his small town wouldn't be hit too hard. But Eppes, a firefighter, had clearly known the power of these huge storms from experiences. "Do you know where the flashlights are?" he asked his wife. Danielle. Just then, thunder was all-around them. The moment he turned the flashlight on. The house lights went off. A second later, the kitchen windows were broken. Eppes and Danielle ran to their boys who were still sleeping in their bedroom. 

"Get up, get up, R.J.! " Eppes shouted, waving his flashlight. The sleepy boy moved to the edge of the bed. Eppes held out his arms and ordered his son to jump. He was too late. The roof was torn down. R.J. was buried ,under the pieces. 

"I've lost him," Eppes thought. Quickly, he hurried to Joel to shield him. Glass, wood, and plaster ( ) hit them. Then something huge, heavy-maybe the washing machine-knocked into him. He hurt his arms, but he still held the flashlight in one hand. 

After a long period, the wind began to die down. Eppes found himself standing in the ruins of his home. Darkness lay all about him. Then he thought he saw a shape moving straight toward him. It was R.J., guided home by the light of his father's flashlight. 

At the hospital later, R.J. described what had happened to him. "I rushed out when the wall started moving I was scared. My mom and dad were gone. Pieces of glass hit my back, and something hit my neck really hard. "

(CNN) -- FBI agents on Friday night searched the Maryland home of the suspect in the recent disappearance of an American woman in Aruba, an agent said. 

The search is occurring in the Gaithersburg residence of Gary Giordano, who is currently being held in an Aruban jail, FBI Special Agent Rich Wolf told CNN. 

Agents, wearing vests that said FBI and carrying empty cardboard and plastic boxes, arrived about 8:40 p.m. Friday. About 15 unmarked cars could be seen on the street, as well as a Montgomery County police vehicle. 

Supervisory Special Agent Philip Celestini, who was at the residence, declined to comment further on the search, citing the active investigation. 

Aruban Solicitor General Taco Stein said earlier Friday that the suspect will appear in court Monday, where an investigating magistrate could order him held for at least eight more days, order him to remain on the island or release him outright due to a lack of evidence. 

Giordano was arrested by Aruban police on August 5, three days after Robyn Gardner was last seen near Baby Beach on the western tip of the Caribbean island. 

Giordano told authorities that he had been snorkeling with Gardner when he signaled to her to swim back, according to a statement. When he reached the beach, Gardner was nowhere to be found, Giordano allegedly said. 

The area that Giordano led authorities to is a rocky, unsightly location that locals say is not a popular snorkeling spot. 

Although prosecutors have continued to identify the 50-year-old American man by his initials, GVG, they also released a photo of a man who appears to be Giordano. His attorney, Michael Lopez, also has said that his client is being held as a suspect in Gardner's death. Lopez has not returned telephone calls seeking comment.  [Q:] Whose house was searched?

Which country grows the most tea? The answer is India. It grows three times as much as China. Which country drinks the most tea? It's neither China nor Japan. It's Great Britain. In the wild, tea plants may be 30 feet tall. But a plant grown for market is pruned. Pruning keeps the plant only three or four feet tall. This is an easy height for tea picking. Only the two top leaves and bud of each new shoot are picked. So to make money, tea plantations must be huge. In general, there are two kinds of tea. Black tea and green tea. Black tea is fermented. In the process, the tea loses nearly all of its healthy qualities. Green tea is steamed right after the leaves are picked. Green tea _ its healthy qualities. For example, it may prevent heart disease. How did we get tea bag? The answer: by accident. Tea merchants used to send samples in tin boxes. This was costly. One merchant thought of a cheaper way. He sent samples in small silk bags. Customers would cut open the bag. They would brew the leaves as usual. One customer put the bag into a pot. Then he just poured hot water over it. And the tea bag was born. Shen Nong was the first to drink tea. (Shen was a Chinese emperor.) This was about 2737 B.C. Shen had bad digestion. So he drank several cups of hot water daily. One day something happened. Leaves from a wild tea tree fell into the hot water pot. The next cup was poured. The water was now colored. Shen sipped it. He liked it. He drank it all. Shen was proud of his new drink. He served it to his guests. Word spread. People thought this way. Tea is good enough for the Emperor. So it must be good enough for the people. Tea became the drink of China. [Q:] Which country consumes tea the most? [A:] Great Britain  [Q:] Which country grows it the most? [A:] India.  [Q:] How tall is the tea plant?

Kabul, Afghanistan (CNN) -- The German news outlet Der Spiegel has published photographs of what appear to be two U.S. soldiers in Afghanistan posing over the bodies of dead Afghans -- images which threaten to further complicate the American military effort there. 

Two images show the soldiers kneeling by a bloody body sprawled over a patch of sand and grass. A third shows what appears to be two bodies propped up, back to back, against a post in front of a military vehicle. 

Der Spiegel identifies the soldiers as Spc. Jeremy Morlock and Pfc. Andrew Holmes, who are both facing charges relating to the wrongful deaths of Afghan civilians. 

Specifically, Holmes is charged with the premeditated deaths of three civilians, possessing a dismembered human finger, wrongfully possessing photographs of human casualties, and smoking hashish. 

He is also accused of conspiring with Morlock to shoot at a civilian and then toss a grenade so it would look like the soldiers were under attack. 

Morlock is charged with three counts of murder. He is accused of killing one Afghan civilian in January 2010 with a grenade and rifle; killing another in May 2010 in a similar manner; and shooting a third to death in February 2010. 

U.S. military rules also prohibit "taking or retaining individual souvenirs or trophies," which the photographs may be construed as. 

The trial for the two soldiers is being conducted at Joint Base Lewis-McChord in Washington. Morlock's court martial is slated to begin Wednesday, while the start date for Holmes' court martial has not been publicly announced.  [Q:] What news agency showed photos of American soldiers? [A:] Der Spiegel  [Q:] From what country? [A:] Germany  [Q:] What were the soldiers doing in the photos? [A:] posing over the bodies of dead Afghans  [Q:] What was the condition of the body?

(CNN)A chiseled boxer's Instagram feed shows him making constant references to the Bible and enjoying gospel singing with his wife. 

Another features his formidable opponent counting stacks of money, hanging out in strip clubs, and flashing diamond watches and Ferraris. 

Welcome to the world of boxing promotion, circa 2015. 

American Floyd Mayweather and Filipino Manny Pacquiao are set to officially announce their heavily anticipated boxing match at a press conference in Los Angeles Wednesday. 

With the combined purse for the May 2 bout in Las Vegas reported to touch $300 million pending viewership numbers, the incentives to self-promote could not be higher. 

"Nowadays you have to be on social media to launch the fight and to build hype," says boxing promoter Nisse Sauerland, CEO of Team Sauerland. "It couldn't be done without it." 

Thirty-eight year old Mayweather (47-0, 26 knockouts), who favors the moniker "The Money Man" or "TBE" (The Best Ever), boasts nearly five million Instagram followers, 5.65 million followers on Twitter and 9.2 million Facebook likes. 

He famously confirmed the fight via Shots, a photo sharing social media application that he's invested in, and displays links to his clothing brand, The Money Team, on all his accounts. 

Along with professing to the be the best fighter of all time, he could also stake a claim to be one of the greatest social media users in sports. 

"I think they're both playing their roles," says Sauerland, who promotes over 45 boxers. "You've got the bad guy and the good guy, really. You've got the guy who throws the money around (Mayweather), that's his image, and Pacquiao, he's the hope of a nation."  [Q:] Who are the two boxer featured in this article?

OCLC, currently incorporated as OCLC Online Computer Library Center, Incorporated, is an American nonprofit cooperative organization "dedicated to the public purposes of furthering access to the world's information and reducing information costs". It was founded in 1967 as the Ohio College Library Center. OCLC and its member libraries cooperatively produce and maintain WorldCat, the largest online public access catalog (OPAC) in the world. OCLC is funded mainly by the fees that libraries have to pay for its services (around $200 million annually ). 

OCLC began in 1967, as the Ohio College Library Center, through a collaboration of Ohio university presidents, vice presidents, and library directors who wanted to create a cooperative, computerized network for Ohio libraries. The group first met on July 5, 1967 on the campus of the Ohio State University to sign the articles of incorporation for the nonprofit organization. The group hired Frederick G. Kilgour, a former Yale University medical school librarian, to design the shared cataloging system. Kilgour wished to merge the latest information storage and retrieval system of the time, the computer, with the oldest, the library. The plan was to merge the catalogs of Ohio libraries electronically through a computer network and database to streamline operations, control costs, and increase efficiency in library management. The goal of this network and database was to bring libraries together to cooperatively keep track of the world's information to best serve researchers and scholars. The first library to do online cataloging through OCLC was the Alden Library at Ohio University on August 26, 1971. This was the first occurrence of online cataloging by any library worldwide.

Tommy was a little boy who lived by a big lake by the woods. One day he saw two little mice looking at the water. They seemed very sad. 

"What is wrong?" Tommy asked. 

Mary, one of the little mice, stood. "My brother and I love to see new things. We want to see what is on the other side of the lake. But we do not know how to build a boat to get there." 

Tommy smiled. "I have plenty of toy boats," he said. "They are your size!" 

"Oh, thank you!" said Steve, the other little mouse. "We would be very glad if we could borrow it!" 

Tommy went to his house and returned with a small toy boat. The boat had a big sail to make the boat go. Mary and Steve climbed on and Tommy put the boat into the water. 

The boat sailed away across the water! Mary and Steve laughed with joy and had great fun riding the toy boat. 

Soon, they reached the other side of the lake. Many people were having fun swimming and splashing in the water. Steve and Mary loved seeing all the new things and people. 

A man threw a ball into the water. It landed by the toy boat. The man's big dog came splashing into the water to fetch it. The big waves splashed the little boat every which way! Mary and Steve got very wet. 

Mary and Steve went back home after that. They told Tommy of what they saw, and they all laughed at the big dog's wave. Tomorrow the mice would see even more of the lake on Tommy's toy boat!

A German taxi-driver, Franz Bussman, recently found his brother who was thought to have been killed twenty years ago. 

While on a walking tour with his wife, he stopped to talk to a workman. After they had gone on, Mrs. Bussman said that the workman was closely like her husband and even suggested that he might be his brother. Franz laughed at the idea, pointing out that his brother had been killed in action during the war. Though Mrs. Busman knew this story quite well, she thought there was a chance in a million that she might be right. 

A few days later, she sent a boy to the workman to ask him if his name was Hans Bussman. Needless to say, the man's name was Hans Bussman. And he really was Franz's long-lost brother. 

When the brothers were reunited, Hans explained how it was that he was still alive. 

After having been wondered towards the end of the war, he had been sent to hospital and was separated from his unit . The hospital had been bombed and Hans had made his way back into Western Germany on foot. Meanwhile, his unit was lost and all records of him had been destroyed. Hans returned to his home, but the house had been bombed up. Guessing that his family had all been killed during an air-raid , Hans settled down in a village fifty miles away where he had remained ever since. [Q:] What happened to the hospital where Hans was?

CHAPTER XXII 

Northward, along the leeward coast of Malaita, the _Ariel_ worked her leisurely way, threading the colour-riotous lagoon that lay between the shore-reefs and outer-reefs, daring passages so narrow and coral-patched that Captain Winters averred each day added a thousand grey hairs to his head, and dropping anchor off every walled inlet of the outer reef and every mangrove swamp of the mainland that looked promising of cannibal life. For Harley and Villa Kennan were in no hurry. So long as the way was interesting, they dared not how long it proved from anywhere to anywhere. 

During this time Jerry learned a new name for himself--or, rather, an entire series of names for himself. This was because of an aversion on Harley Kennan's part against renaming a named thing. 

"A name he must have had," he argued to Villa. "Haggin must have named him before he sailed on the _Arangi_. Therefore, nameless he must be until we get back to Tulagi and find out his real name." 

"What's in a name?" Villa had begun to tease. 

"Everything," her husband retorted. "Think of yourself, shipwrecked, called by your rescuers 'Mrs. Riggs,' or 'Mademoiselle de Maupin,' or just plain 'Topsy.' And think of me being called 'Benedict Arnold,' or ' Judas,' or . . . or . . . 'Haman.' No, keep him nameless, until we find out his original name." 

"Must call him something," she objected. "Can't think of him without thinking something." 

"Then call him many names, but never the same name twice. Call him 'Dog' to-day, and 'Mister Dog' to-morrow, and the next day something else."  [Q:] What worked her way northward? [A:] The _Ariel_  [Q:] What lay between the shore-reefs and outer-reefs? [A:] Lagoon  [Q:] Were the passages wide? [A:] No  [Q:] Who was the Captain? [A:] Winters  [Q:] Did he have red hair? [A:] No  [Q:] Were Harley and Villa in a hurry? [A:] No  [Q:] What coast did the Ariel work her way up leisurely? [A:] Malaita  [Q:] Who argued to Villa that he must have a name? [A:] Harley Kennan  [Q:] Who began to tease Harley? [A:] Villa  [Q:] What ship had Haggin sailed on? [A:] The Arangi  [Q:] How long must he be nameless until? [A:] Until they get back to Tulagi  [Q:] Who was the husband she retorted something to? [A:] Harley Kennan  [Q:] Did she tell him to think of himself being in an airplane crash? [A:] No  [Q:] What would an awkward name to be called by rescuers be? [A:] 'Mrs. Riggs'  [Q:] What's another one? [A:] 'Topsy'  [Q:] How about a third one? [A:] 'Mademoiselle de Maupin'  [Q:] Did she ask Villa to think of her being called Jesus? [A:] No  [Q:] Was there a lot of coral in the lagoon? [A:] Yes  [Q:] Where did the Ariel drop anchor off of? [A:] Every walled inlet of the outer reef and every mangrove swamp of the mainland that looked promising of cannibal life.  [Q:] Were there cannibals? [A:] unknown
Brownie and Spotty were neighbor dogs who met every day to play together. These two loved each other and played together so often that they had worn a path through the grass of the field between their respective houses. One evening, Brownie's family noticed that Brownie hadn't returned home. They went looking for him with no success and by the next week he was still missing. Curiously, Spotty showed up at Brownie's house alone. Barking, whining and generally pestering Brownie's human family. Busy with their own lives, they just ignored the nervous little neighbor dog. Continuously,Ted, Brownie's owner, was disturbed by the angry, determined little dog. Spotty followed Ted about, barking insistently, then rushing toward a nearby empty lot and back, as if to say, "Follow me! It's urgent!" Eventually, Ted followed Spotty to a deserted spot half a mile from the house. There Ted found his beloved Brownie alive, one of his hind legs crushed in a steel leghold trap. Horrified, Ted now wished he'd taken Spotty's earlier appeals seriously. Then Ted noticed something quite remarkable. Spotty had done more than simply led Brownie's human owner to his trapped friend. In a circle around the injured dog, Ted found an array of dog food and table scraps which were later identified as the remains of every meal Spotty had been fed that week! Spotty had been visiting Brownie regularly, in the hope of keeping his friend alive by sacrificing his own comfort. Spotty had evidently stayed with Brownie to protect him from hunger and other dangers, and keep his spirits up. Brownie's leg was treated by a veterinarian and he recovered. For many years thereafter, the two families watched the faithful friends chasing each other down that well worn path between their houses.

This is the story of a young girl and her dog. The young girl and her dog set out a trip into the woods one day. Upon entering the woods the girl and her dog found that the woods were dark and cold. The girl was a little scared and was thinking of turning back, but yet they went on. The girl's dog was acting very interested in what was in the bushes up ahead. To both the girl and the dog's surprise, there was a small brown bear resting in the bushes. The bear was not surprised and did not seem at all interested in the girl and her dog. The bear looked up at the girl and it was almost as if he was smiling at her. He then rested his head on his bear paws and went back to sleep. The girl and the dog kept walking and finally made it out of the woods. To this day the girl does not know why the bear was so friendly and to this day she has never told anyone about the meeting with the bear in the woods. [Q:] What is the story about?

HOUSTON (AP) --- A 10-year-old boy fatally shot his father Friday, striking him several times as he sat in the front seat of a SUV to pick up the boy from his mother's home for a weekend visit. 

The incident happened about 3pm on a cul-desac in the 1700 block of Cedar Cove Court, said Sgt. Williams of the Harris County Sheriff's Department. 

An investigation found that Rick James Lohstroh, 41, was shot by his son, who was sitting in the back seat of the man's Toyota 4-Runner, said Sgt. Williams. The shooting took place outside the home of Lohstroh's ex-wife, where the boy lives with his mother and a 7-year-old brother. 

"We're not certain of anything until we finish our investigation," Williams said. "The information we have at this time is that the 10-year-old did fire the weapon." 

The mother and the 7-year-old were inside the house when the shooting occurred, said Williams. 

Williams said the gun belonged to the boy's mother. After firing shots through the back seat, the boy exited the back of the vehicle and continued to fire at the car. 

The man died on the way to Memorial Herman Hospital. 

Lohstroh was a doctor at the University of Texas Medical Branch. 

The man and woman shared custody of the children. 

Williams said the mother and the boy were still in the home talking to investigators Friday night. 

Neighbors described the family as being quiet and keeping to themselves. 

Justin Gray, 17, was walking in the neighborhood when he heard gunshots. "We've had a suicide in this neighborhood once, but never anything like this," Gray said. [Q:] What happened Friday?

CHAPTER FIFTY FIVE. 

WAITING. 

The lengthening sunny days went on without bringing either what Romola most desired or what she most dreaded. They brought no sign from Baldassarre, and, in spite of special watch on the part of the Government, no revelation of the suspected conspiracy. But they brought other things which touched her closely, and bridged the phantom-crowded space of anxiety with active sympathy in immediate trial. They brought the spreading Plague and the Excommunication of Savonarola. 

Both these events tended to arrest her incipient alienation from the Frate, and to rivet again her attachment to the man who had opened to her the new life of duty, and who seemed now to be worsted in the fight for principle against profligacy. For Romola could not carry from day to day into the abodes of pestilence and misery the sublime excitement of a gladness that, since such anguish existed, she too existed to make some of the anguish less bitter, without remembering that she owed this transcendent moral life to Fra Girolamo. She could not witness the silencing and excommunication of a man whose distinction from the great mass of the clergy lay, not in any heretical belief, not in his superstitions, but in the energy with which he sought to make the Christian life a reality, without feeling herself drawn strongly to his side. 

Far on in the hot days of June the Excommunication, for some weeks arrived from Rome, was solemnly published in the Duomo. Romola went to witness the scene, that the resistance it inspired might invigorate that sympathy with Savonarola which was one source of her strength. It was in memorable contrast with the scene she had been accustomed to witness there.  [Q:] Who was excommunicated? [A:] Fra Girolamo  [Q:] Was he a heretic? [A:] no  [Q:] Was he superstitious? [A:] no  [Q:] Why was he excommunicated then? [A:] unknown  [Q:] Who was inspired by this man? [A:] Romola  [Q:] Where was the Excommunication published? [A:] in the Duomo  [Q:] When? [A:] June  [Q:] How long was it published? [A:] for some weeks  [Q:] What was Romola looking for? [A:] a sign from Baldassarre  [Q:] What else was she looking for? [A:] sympathy with Savonarola  [Q:] What did the summer days bring? [A:] Plague  [Q:] Who was she alienated from? [A:] the Frate  [Q:] Did Romola fight the plague? [A:] no

NEW YORK (CNN) -- Natasha Richardson, a film star, Tony-winning stage actress and member of the famed Redgrave acting family, died Wednesday after suffering injuries in a ski accident, according to a family statement. She was 45. 

Natasha Richardson fell on a beginners' slope in Canada. 

Richardson, wife of actor Liam Neeson, was injured Monday in a fall on a ski slope at a Quebec resort about 80 miles northwest of Montreal.

Peter was a very sad puppy. He had been inside of the pet store for a very long time. In fact, he had been there for three months! Peter had seen many other puppies find a person; he began to wonder why he could not get one. He thought that maybe his fur was not pretty enough or maybe his bark was not loud enough.

(CNN) -- For Heather Neroy, it used to be a tedious process: Whenever she came across an interesting arts-and-crafts project or recipe on the Internet, she would save it for later by copying the link, pasting it into an e-mail and sending it to herself. 

After that Neroy, a stay-at-home mom from Southern California, would file the e-mail in a folder for future reference. It wasn't exactly the most efficient system. 

Then last year, during one of her browsing sessions, she read a blog post that gushed about a new website called Pinterest. The virtual pinboard, where users can pin and organize images onto individual "boards," didn't pique Neroy's interest at first, but she quickly changed her mind. 

"Someone described it as an online filing system, and I thought, 'That's exactly what I need,' " she said. 

Soon Neroy was pinning away and, like many Pinterest users, got quickly hooked. She first started with a Halloween board where she pinned costume ideas. Next, Neroy created a shared color board for redecorating her daughter's bedroom that she and her husband could add to. 

Pinterest also allows other users to follow each other's boards and "re-pin" another person's images. In no time Neroy was sharing other people's pins and following users with similar tastes. 

"It's been really neat to see what other moms are pinning," she said. "Some days you run out of ideas and you don't know what to do to fill the time before bedtime. I thought it was going to be just me organizing, but it's really a community sharing all these different ideas that I didn't even know existed."  [Q:] What is the main character interested in?

Chapter XVIII 

The Hound Restored 

On the third day after his arrival at the camp Archie received orders to prepare to start with the hound, with the earl and a large party of men-at-arms, in search of Bruce. A traitor had just come in and told them where Bruce had slept the night before. Reluctantly Archie unfastened the chain from the pole, and holding the end in his hand went round with Hector to the front of the pavilion. He was resolved that if under the dog's guidance the party came close up with Bruce, he would kill the dog and then try to escape by fleetness of foot, though of this, as there were so many mounted men in the party, he had but slight hope. Led by the peasant they proceeded to the hut, which was five miles away in the hills. On reaching it Hector at once became greatly excited. He sniffed here and there, eagerly hunted up and down the cottage, then made a circuit round it, and at last, with a loud deep bay he started off with his nose to the ground, pulling so hard at the chain that Archie had difficulty in keeping up with him. Pembroke and his knights rode a little behind, followed by their men-at-arms. 

"I pray you, Sir Earl," Archie said, "keep not too close to my traces, for the sound of the horse's hoofs and the jingling of the equipments make him all the more impatient to get forward, and even now it taxes all my strength to hold him in."  [Q:] To whom did Archie pray? [A:] Sir Earl  [Q:] And what should Sir Earl not get too close to? [A:] Archie's traces.  [Q:] What does the sound of horse's hoofs make him impatient to do?

Asuncion, Paraguay (CNN) -- Paraguay installed new top military commanders, but President Fernando Lugo, who had ordered the change in leadership, was not present for the ceremony. 

Lugo's absence Thursday morning attracted attention given his administration's silence on the sudden change in the leadership of the country's army, air force and navy. 

The president's decision to replace the top brass came a day after he publicly dismissed rumors about a military coup. 

Brig. Gen. Bartolome Ramon Pineda Ortiz was named as the new army commander. Brig. Gen. Hugo Gilberto Aranda Chamorro and Rear Adm. Egberto Emerito Orie Benegas took over the top posts at the air force and navy, respectively. 

The announcement came from the armed forces, not the president's office. 

Cibar Benitez, commander of the armed forces, was the only top leader to retain his post. 

Other changes would be forthcoming in the lower ranks, said Benitez at the swearing-in ceremony, but he denied there was any truth to talk of a coup. 

Paraguay's history is filled with unstable transitions of power since it emerged from dictatorship in 1989. Although there hasn't been a coup since that year, there were attempted coups in 1996 and 2000, and President Raul Cubas resigned amid controversy in 1999. 

The military shakeup is the third since Lugo took office. The former Catholic bishop was elected to a five-year term last year. His victory brought an end to six decades of one-party rule in Paraguay, but the honeymoon did not last long. 

In April, Lugo admitted that he fathered a child while he was still a priest and that he may have fathered more. The revelation, which came as a shock to most, hurt his political image. Calls for his resignation began, and have continued as Lugo has struggled to push reforms through a majority-opposition legislature.

Buckinghamshire ( or ), abbreviated Bucks, is a county in South East England which borders Greater London to the south east, Berkshire to the south, Oxfordshire to the west, Northamptonshire to the north, Bedfordshire to the north east and Hertfordshire to the east. 

Buckinghamshire is one of the home counties and towns such as High Wycombe, Amersham, Chesham and the Chalfonts in the east and southeast of the county are parts of the London commuter belt, forming some of the most densely-populated parts of the county. Development in this region is restricted by the Metropolitan Green Belt. Other large settlements include the county town of Aylesbury, Marlow in the south near the Thames and Princes Risborough in the west near Oxford. Some areas without direct rail links to London, such as around the old county town of Buckingham and near Olney in the northeast, are much less populous. The largest town is Milton Keynes in the northeast, which with the surrounding area is administered as a unitary authority separately to the rest of Buckinghamshire. The remainder of the county is administered by Buckinghamshire County Council as a non-metropolitan county, and four district councils. In national elections, Buckinghamshire is considered a reliable supporter of the Conservative Party.

Chapter 17: The Battle Of Moncontor. 

When Pierre left him in order to look after the horses, Philip continued his meal. There could be no hurry, for Nevers was twelve miles away; and it would be four hours, at least, before a party could arrive. 

The landlady herself brought in the next course. After placing the dish upon the table, she stood looking earnestly at him for a minute, and then said: 

"You spoke of stopping here tonight, sir. The accommodation is very poor and, if you will take my advice, you will ride farther. There have been some men along here this afternoon, inquiring for a party like yours; and offering a reward to any who would carry the news to them, should you pass through. Methinks their intentions were not friendly." 

"I thank you very much for your counsel," Philip said, "and will take it. I know that there are some who would gladly hinder me, in my journey; and if there is, as you say, a risk of their coming here for me, it were as well that I rode farther, although I would gladly have given my horses a night's rest. I thank you warmly for having warned me." 

"Do not let my husband know that I have spoken to you," she said. "He is an honest man, but timid; and in these days 'tis safest not to meddle with what does not concern one." 

Philip waited for two hours, and then told Pierre to saddle the horses, and tell the landlord that he wished to speak to him.  [Q:] Who was eating? [A:] Philip  [Q:] Did Pierre leave him? [A:] yes  [Q:] Why? [A:] to look after the horses,  [Q:] How far is Nevers? [A:] twelve miles away  [Q:] How long before someone would arrive?

Wiltshire ( or ) is a county in South West England with an area of . It is landlocked and borders the counties of Dorset, Somerset, Hampshire, Gloucestershire, Oxfordshire and Berkshire. The county town was originally Wilton, after which the county is named, but Wiltshire Council is now based in the county town of Trowbridge. 

Wiltshire is characterised by its high downland and wide valleys. Salisbury Plain is noted for being the location of the Stonehenge and Avebury stone circles and other ancient landmarks, and as a training area for the British Army. The city of Salisbury is notable for its mediaeval cathedral. Important country houses open to the public include Longleat, near Warminster, and the National Trust's Stourhead, near Mere. 

The county, in the 9th century written as "Wiltunscir", later "Wiltonshire", is named after the former county town of Wilton. 

Wiltshire is notable for its pre-Roman archaeology. The Mesolithic, Neolithic and Bronze Age people that occupied southern Britain built settlements on the hills and downland that cover Wiltshire. Stonehenge and Avebury are perhaps the most famous Neolithic sites in the UK. 

In the 6th and 7th centuries Wiltshire was at the western edge of Saxon Britain, as Cranborne Chase and the Somerset Levels prevented the advance to the west. The Battle of Bedwyn was fought in 675 between Escuin, a West Saxon nobleman who had seized the throne of Queen Saxburga, and King Wulfhere of Mercia. In 878 the Danes invaded the county. Following the Norman Conquest, large areas of the country came into the possession of the crown and the church. [Q:] What is Wiltshire characterised by?

Marsha loves playing with her noodle friend. She had it for a long time so it is now a dark brown color. When her mom first made it, it was white. The night she met her noodle friend was spaghetti night. Marsha's favorite dinner was spaghetti, which happened to be every Tuesday night. On one Tuesday, a piece of spaghetti fell on the kitchen floor. To Marsha, it looked like a stick man so she kept him. She named her new noodle friend Joey and took him everywhere she went. Sometimes Joey gets a little dried out so Marsha's mom told her to soak him in water every few days. There were a couple times that the family dog, Mika, has tried to take Joey from Marsha and eat him! So from now on, Marsha takes extra special care to make sure Joey is safe and sound at all times.

"Baby born to woe." 

F. T. PALGRAVE. 

When Anne Woodford began to wake from the constant thought of the grief and horror she had left at Portchester, and to feel more alive to her surroundings and less as if they were a kind of dream, in which she only mechanically took her part, one thing impressed itself on her gradually, and that was disappointment. If the previous shock had not blunted all her hopes and aspirations, perhaps she would have felt it sooner and more keenly; but she could not help realising that she had put herself into an inferior position whence there did not seem to be the promotion she had once anticipated. Her companion rockers were of an inferior grade to herself. Jane Humphreys was a harmless but silly girl, not much wiser, though less spoilt, than poor little Madam, and full of Cockney vulgarities. Education was unfashionable just then, and though Hester Bridgeman was bettor born and bred, being the daughter of an attorney in the city, she was not much better instructed, and had no pursuits except that of her own advantage. Pauline Dunord was by far the best of the three, but she seemed to live a life apart, taking very little interest in her companions or anything around her except her devotions and the bringing them over to her Church. The nursery was quite a separate establishment; there was no mingling with the guests of royalty, who were only seen in excited peeps from the window, or when solemnly introduced to the presence chamber to pay their respects to the Prince. As to books, the only secular one that Anne saw while at Whitehall was an odd volume of Parthenissa. The late King's summary of the Roman controversy was to be had in plenty, and nothing was more evident than that the only road to favour or promotion was in being thereby convinced.

TOM'S JOKE 

"What did you do to him?" asked Sam, quickly. 

"Put an advertisement of pills on his back and some other ads. in his text books," answered Tom. "Say, he looks some mad; doesn't he?" 

"I should say yes," came from Stanley. 

William Philander was approaching with long strides. In one hand he held the poster Tom had fastened on his back, and he was shaking his other fist wrathfully. 

"Tom Rover, you've--er--insulted me!" he gasped as he came up. "You've humiliated me before the whole class! I'll--I'll----" The dudish student was so full of wrath he could not speak. 

"Take a cough drop and clear your throat Billy," suggested Tom, coolly. "Don't get so excited, you might drop dead from heart disease." 

"How dare you put that--er--that advertisement of Gumley's Red Pills on my back?" stormed the stylishly-dressed one. 

"'Gumley's Red Pills for Red-Blooded People,'" quoted Spud, from the poster. "Say, they are fine, Willie. Didn't you ever take 'em?" 

"No, and I don't want to. I want Tom Ro----" 

"Say, if you haven't taken any of Gumley's pills you don't know what you've missed," went on Spud, with a wink at the others. "Why, there was a man over in Rottenberg who was flat on his back with half a dozen fatal diseases. The doctors gave him just three days to live,--three days, think of it! His wife nearly cried her eyes out. Then along came this Gumley man with a trunk full of his Red Pills for Red-Blooded People. He didn't exactly know if the dying man was red-blooded or not, but he took a chance and gave the fellow sixteen pills, four after breakfast, four after dinner, four after supper and four on retiring, and the next day, what do you think happened? That man got up and went to work, and he's been at his Job ever since."  [Q:] who played a prank? [A:] Tom  [Q:] on who? [A:] William  [Q:] who asks him about it? [A:] Sam  [Q:] what did Sam ask?

He makes sure to feed them every morning and evening and always checks to see if the cats have water. Sometimes he feeds them special treats because he loves them. Each cat gets 3 treats.

CHAPTER XXXIV 

Arthur remained at the gate while Ruth climbed Maria's front steps. She heard the rapid click of the type-writer, and when Martin let her in, found him on the last page of a manuscript. She had come to make certain whether or not he would be at their table for Thanksgiving dinner; but before she could broach the subject Martin plunged into the one with which he was full. 

"Here, let me read you this," he cried, separating the carbon copies and running the pages of manuscript into shape. "It's my latest, and different from anything I've done. It is so altogether different that I am almost afraid of it, and yet I've a sneaking idea it is good. You be judge. It's an Hawaiian story. I've called it 'Wiki-wiki.'" 

His face was bright with the creative glow, though she shivered in the cold room and had been struck by the coldness of his hands at greeting. She listened closely while he read, and though he from time to time had seen only disapprobation in her face, at the close he asked:- 

"Frankly, what do you think of it?" 

"I--I don't know," she, answered. "Will it--do you think it will sell?" 

"I'm afraid not," was the confession. "It's too strong for the magazines. But it's true, on my word it's true." 

"But why do you persist in writing such things when you know they won't sell?" she went on inexorably. "The reason for your writing is to make a living, isn't it?"  [Q:] What was Martin working on? [A:] A manuscript  [Q:] What was it called? [A:] Wiki-wiki  [Q:] Does it take place in Tahiti? [A:] No  [Q:] Where? [A:] In Hawai'i  [Q:] How many similar stories had he written before?

[A:] To see whether he is coming for Thanksgiving  [Q:] Did he answer her? [A:] No  [Q:] Did she ask? [A:] No  [Q:] Did she come with anyone else? [A:] Yes  [Q:] Who? [A:] WIth Arthur  [Q:] Where did she leave him? [A:] At the gate  [Q:] Who does Martin live with? [A:] Maria  [Q:] Does Ruth read his manuscript to herself? [A:] No  [Q:] Who reads it?

(CNN)Formula One star Fernando Alonso returned to work at McLaren on Wednesday following his freak accident in winter testing. 

The Spanish double world champion was ruled out of the opening race in Australia by doctors treating him for the effects of a high speed crash. 

Alonso has been training hard for his planned comeback at the Malaysian Grand Prix in nine days' time and used the McLaren simulator to hone his mental preparations. 

The CNN-sponsored team announced the news on Twitter, showing McLaren sporting director Eric Boullier and Alonso at the team's headquarters in Woking, England. 

Alonso was concussed and airlifted to hospital after losing control of his McLaren at the penultimate winter test at Barcelona's Circuit de Catalunya on February 22. 

The 33-year-old watched the Melbourne race from his home in Dubai after doctors indicated returning to racing three weeks after a high impact was too risky. 

McLaren had explained that Alonso's "accident was caused by the unpredictably gusty winds at that part of the circuit at that time." 

After getting back to race preparation in the simulator, McLaren tweeted that it had been a good day for Alonso, "focusing on operational work and practicing qualifying and race procedures." 

The media enjoyed a guessing game in Australia about just how Alonso might have reacted to events in Melbourne, where Lewis Hamilton and his mighty Mercedes dominated while Alonso's McLaren teammate Jenson Button finished in last place. 

Dane Kevin Magnussen, who was deputizing for the recuperating Spaniard, was unable to start the race because of engine problems on his way to the starting grid.  [Q:] From where did Alfonso watch the Melbourne race? [A:] home  [Q:] Why? [A:] injured in a traing crash  [Q:] What was the cause of the collision? [A:] gusty winds on the track  [Q:] When did the injury happen? [A:] February 22.  [Q:] And where? [A:] Barcelona  [Q:] What did he use to sharpen his skills? [A:] McLaren's simulator  [Q:] For what was he planning? [A:] comeback at Malaysian GP  [Q:] Who prevailed when he wasn't able to attend finally? [A:] Lewis Hamilton  [Q:] What title does he hold? [A:] double world champion  [Q:] Where is his organization based? [A:] Woking, England
CHAPTER V. 

MESSRS. TREAT, JONES, WESTON & DOWD. 

The particular circle of society in which Ben and Johnny moved was shaken to its very centre by the news which was whispered from one to the other on the day after those young gentlemen and Paul had taken up their abode at Mrs. Green's. 

Early that morning the most exciting topic of conversation had been Master Spry's misfortune and Tim Dooley's perfidy; and that had hardly begun to be commented upon when the news spread that Ben and Johnny, since the coming of their guest, who was evidently a suspicious sort of a person, as was shown by his clothes and his entire ignorance of the slang of the street, were no longer proud of their neat little bit of real estate, but had made a change which would probably be the means of their financial ruin. That they had been so extravagant as to engage rooms at a regular boarding-house, where they were to spend their substance on three square meals each day, seemed like a reckless disregard of money; and the price which they were to pay for board was stated at various sums from five to ten dollars per week. But that was not the only bit of wonderful news. 

Jimmy Sullivan stated--and he was supported by several others as the time wore on--that Johnny himself had told him that they were to start a regular theatre, and had already engaged a hall, which would be converted into a first-class place of amusement as soon as possible. This would have been regarded simply as a rumor started for the purpose of injuring the credit of these young gentlemen, had it not come so directly from one of the parties concerned, and must therefore be true.  [Q:] Who started to live at Mrs Green's? [A:] Ben, Johnny, and Paul  [Q:] How could you tell Paul was a person to be suspected? [A:] his clothes and his ignorance of the slang  [Q:] What kind of lingo was it? [A:] slang of the street  [Q:] Name one of the things that was rumored to lead to their money troubles? [A:] they had engaged rooms at a regular boarding-house  [Q:] Anot?her [A:] they were to pay for three square meals each day  [Q:] What was the low estimate of the money they were spending? [A:] five dollars per week  [Q:] And the high estimate? [A:] ten dollars per week  [Q:] What had people been gossiping about before they started on Ben and Johnny? [A:] Master Spry's misfortune and Tim Dooley's perfidy  [Q:] So were people having fun with this gossip? [A:] yes  [Q:] What did they think of it? [A:] That it was wonderful news.  [Q:] How did they communicate with each other about it? [A:] whispered from one to the other  [Q:] What did Johnny tell Jimmy Sullivan about? [A:] that they were to start a regular theatre  [Q:] Did people believe Jimmy? [A:] yes  [Q:] Would doing that be a bad thing? [A:] yes  [Q:] What had Johnny done about beginning the project? [A:] he had already engaged a hall  [Q:] Was it going to be used as is? [A:] no  [Q:] What was going to happen to it? [A:] it would be converted into a first-class place of amusement  [Q:] When? [A:] as soon as possible  [Q:] Was this only a rumor? [A:] It was not thought to be so.  [Q:] Why not? [A:] Because it came directly from one of the parties concerned.

Sean the dragon liked the color green. He didn't like golden coins. They were too yellow. Every day he would go out and find green things to cover his bed of old treasure. He would put grass and clovers and leaves and vines all over his cave. The other dragons were worried. When you breathe fire, it's not a good idea to sleep around a lot of plants. They were afraid Sean might get hurt. Sean didn't think so but his bed never stayed green and he was getting tired of doing nothing but making his bed. One day he went to visit his friend Zarah and he saw a piece of green in a golden necklace. "What's that?" he asked. "That's a green stone," she told him. "Sometimes my treasures have them. I don't really like them. They're too green. I like yellow things." "If I bring you yellow things, can I have it?" Sean asked. "Yes you can," Zarah said, "But it has to be treasure, or things that won't catch fire." So Sean went to go find treasure. When he was gone Zarah told the other dragons. They said that they would trade all their green treasure to Sean too so he could have a safe dragon bed in his cave. Soon Sean had more than enough green stones to cover his bed. Green stones never got old and brown. They don't catch fire either. So, now everyone was happy. [Q:] did Sean like golden coins? [A:] No.  [Q:] why? [A:] They were too yellow.  [Q:] what color things did he use to cover his treasure? [A:] Green.  [Q:] did he cover his cave? [A:] No.  [Q:] did he put stuff all over his cave? [A:] Yes.  [Q:] like what? [A:] Grass, clovers, leaves, and vines.  [Q:] who was worried? [A:] The other dragons.  [Q:] were they afraid he might get hurt? [A:] Yes.  [Q:] did Sean agree? [A:] No.  [Q:] who did Sean visit? [A:] Zarah.  [Q:] what did he see when visiting Zarah? [A:] A piece of green in a golden necklace.
CHAPTER XII 

"Throw your coat down anywhere, Miss Baldwin," Wingate invited, as he ushered that young lady into his rooms soon after eleven o'clock on the following evening. "Now what can I give you? There are some sandwiches here--ham and pâté-de-foie-gras, I think. Whisky and soda or some hock?" 

"A pâté sandwich and some plain soda water, please," Sarah replied, taking off the long motoring coat which concealed her evening clothes. "I have been fined for everything except disorderly driving--daren't risk that. Thanks!" she went on. "What ripping sandwiches! And quite a good play, wasn't it?" 

"I am glad you enjoyed it." 

"It was a swindle Josephine not turning up," Sarah continued, as she stretched herself out in Wingate's easy-chair. "Domestic ructions again, I suppose. How I do hate that husband of hers!" 

"It was disappointing," he admitted. 

There was a brief pause, during which Sarah finished her sandwiches and lit a cigarette. 

"Wilshaw seems to be having a little trouble with the outside porter," her host remarked presently. 

"It must cost him at least half a sovereign every time I leave the cab," Sarah sighed. 

"How much do you make a week out of your driving, if it isn't too personal a question?" he enquired. 

"It depends upon how much Jimmy's got." 

"Is he your only client, then?" 

"He very seldom gives me a chance of another. Once or twice I've refused to be engaged by the day, but he sends his man around to the garage and I find him sitting in the cab when I arrive."  [Q:] Who did Wingate talk to? [A:] Miss Baldwin  [Q:] What is her first name? [A:] Sarah  [Q:] Does she smoke? [A:] Yes  [Q:] When did this exchange happen?

Pope Benedict XVI (; ; ; born Joseph Aloisius Ratzinger; ; born 16 April 1927) served as Pope from 2005 until his resignation in 2013. Benedict's election occurred in the 2005 papal conclave that followed the death of Pope John Paul II. Since his resignation, Benedict holds the title Pope Emeritus. 

Ordained as a priest in 1951 in his native Bavaria, Ratzinger established himself as a highly regarded university theologian by the late 1950s and was appointed a full professor in 1958. After a long career as an academic and professor of theology at several German universities, he was appointed Archbishop of Munich and Freising and Cardinal by Pope Paul VI in 1977, an unusual promotion for someone with little pastoral experience. In 1981, he was appointed Prefect of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, one of the most important dicasteries of the Roman Curia. From 2002 until his election as Pope, he was also Dean of the College of Cardinals. Prior to becoming Pope, he was "a major figure on the Vatican stage for a quarter of a century"; he had an influence "second to none when it came to setting church priorities and directions" as one of John Paul II's closest confidants.

CHAPTER X 

CAUGHT IN A STORM 

"Did you ever know this Wilbur Poole, Dad?" questioned Ben. 

"Yes, I met him years ago at Aaron Poole's home. But of course he was in his right mind then. Poor chap! I pity him very much." 

"I think we all pity him," answered Dave. "Nobody can be responsible after his mind breaks down." 

"I feel sorry for Nat Poole and his folks," said Laura. "This will give them a great deal of trouble, not to mention the expense." 

"If Wilbur Poole was anywhere around Rayville it might pay to start a hunt for him," suggested Roger. 

"I don't think you'll find him anywhere around here," answered Mr. Basswood. "But it won't hurt to take a look around, if you boys care to take a walk." 

Ben's father went off to send his telegram to Aaron Poole, and all the boys set off on a hunt for the wild man. They covered the streets of the village and some of the roads on the outskirts, but without success. They met three people who had talked to the strange individual, and from what had passed Dave and his chums were sure that the man must have been Wilbur Poole. 

"I guess we'll have to give it up," said Phil, when it was getting late. "I'm tired out. And remember, fellows, we have a hard ride before us to-morrow if we expect to reach Carpen Falls in time to hit the trail for Bear Camp before it gets dark."  [Q:] Where did Ben's father meet Wilbur? [A:] at Aaron Poole's home  [Q:] How was Wilbur different at that time? [A:] he was in his right mind  [Q:] How many different Poole family members are mentioned? [A:] Three  [Q:] What were their names? [A:] Aaron, Wilbur and Nat  [Q:] Does Mr. Basswood think Wilbur is nearby? [A:] no  [Q:] Does he say they should not search nearby? [A:] no  [Q:] What does Ben's dad go to send? [A:] a telegram  [Q:] To whom? [A:] Aaron Poole  [Q:] What do the boys do meanwhile? [A:] set off on a hunt  [Q:] For whom? [A:] the wild man  [Q:] Do they find him? [A:] no  [Q:] Do they find any sign that he has been there? [A:] yes  [Q:] What sign? [A:] three people who had talked to him  [Q:] When do they stop the search? [A:] when it was getting late  [Q:] Whose idea was that? [A:] Phil  [Q:] Why does he want to stop? [A:] he's tired  [Q:] Do they have plans for the next day? [A:] yes  [Q:] What will they do? [A:] ride to Carpen Falls  [Q:] Will it be a short and easy trip there? [A:] no  [Q:] What do they want to do when they arrive there? [A:] hit the trail for Bear Camp
A thorough understanding of adolescence in society depends on information from various perspectives, including psychology, biology, history, sociology, education, and anthropology. Within all of these perspectives, adolescence is viewed as a transitional period between childhood and adulthood, whose cultural purpose is the preparation of children for adult roles. It is a period of multiple transitions involving education, training, employment and unemployment, as well as transitions from one living circumstance to another. 

Puberty occurs through a long process and begins with a surge in hormone production, which in turn causes a number of physical changes. It is the stage of life characterized by the appearance and development of secondary sex characteristics (for example, a deeper voice and larger adam's apple in boys, and development of breasts and more curved and prominent hips in girls) and a strong shift in hormonal balance towards an adult state. This is triggered by the pituitary gland, which secretes a surge of hormonal agents into the blood stream, initiating a chain reaction to occur. The male and female gonads are subsequently activated, which puts them into a state of rapid growth and development; the triggered gonads now commence the mass production of the necessary chemicals. The testes primarily release testosterone, and the ovaries predominantly dispense estrogen. The production of these hormones increases gradually until sexual maturation is met. Some boys may develop gynecomastia due to an imbalance of sex hormones, tissue responsiveness or obesity. [Q:] What connect childhood and adulthood? [A:] adolescence  [Q:] What one word best describes it? [A:] unknown  [Q:] What non-biological purpose does it have? [A:] cultural  [Q:] What's the long biological process that happens during it? [A:] puberty  [Q:] What develops during this? [A:] secondary sex characeristics  [Q:] What's an example? [A:] a deeper voice in boys  [Q:] What causes these developments? [A:] the pituitary gland  [Q:] What does the pituitary gland alter? [A:] the male and female gonads  [Q:] What alters those? [A:] hormonal agents  [Q:] What can happen if the balance of those agents change too much? [A:] gynecomastia  [Q:] What else can cause that? [A:] tissue responsiveness or obesity  [Q:] What carries the hormones? [A:] the testes and the ovaries
CHAPTER XX. 

Moving against Captain Grady 

Both Paul and Chet Winthrop were deeply interested in the words uttered by Jeff Jones, the colored member of the horse thieves' gang. 

"So you know something of Captain Grady and our uncle, Barnaby Winthrop?" cried Chet, excitedly. "What do you know?" 

"Dat's fer you two fellers ter find out--onless yer let's me go," replied Jeff Jones, suggestively. 

"You mean you won't speak unless we grant you your liberty?" put in Paul. 

"Dat's de way to figure it." 

Paul looked at Chet inquiringly. 

"We can't promise anything until Mr. Dottery gets back," said Chet. "But if you know anything about our uncle you had better speak out, if you wish us to do anything at all for you." 

"I won't say a word," growled the colored man. 

Chet bit his lip in vexation. 

"Don't you know what it is to have us able to speak a word for you?" said Paul. "Supposing we let Jack Blowfen take you over to the next camp and tell the men that you are a downright horse thief? Would you fancy that?" 

Jeff Jones began to tremble. He knew what Paul meant--that he would be lynched inside the hour. In that section of the country, at that time, horse stealing was considered almost as bad as murder. 

"No! no! doan let him take me down ter de Fork!" howled Jeff Jones. "Anyt'ing but dat, boys!" 

"Well, you, had better talk, then," returned Paul, severely. 

"I doan know much, but I'll tell yo' all I do know," said the prisoner, after a short pause, "and yo' is ter do de best yo' can fo' me, promise me dat?"  [Q:] Who is the colored man? [A:] Jeff Jones  [Q:] What was he doing? [A:] Stealing horses  [Q:] How many people is he with? [A:] two  [Q:] Who? [A:] Paul and Chet Winthrop  [Q:] What were they doing together?

The Federal City of Bonn () is a city on the banks of the Rhine in the German state of North Rhine-Westphalia, with a population of over 300,000. About south-southeast of Cologne, Bonn is in the southernmost part of the Rhine-Ruhr region, Germany's largest metropolitan area, with over 11 million inhabitants. 

Together with the capital Berlin, the city is the "de facto" joint seat of government of Germany. Bonn is the secondary seat of the President, the Chancellor, the Bundesrat and the primary seat of six federal government ministries and twenty federal authorities. The title of Federal City () reflects its important political status within Germany. 

Founded in the 1st century BC as a Roman settlement, Bonn is one of Germany's oldest cities. From 1597 to 1794, Bonn was the capital of the Electorate of Cologne, and residence of the Archbishops and Prince-electors of Cologne. Composer Ludwig van Beethoven was born in Bonn in 1770. From 1949 to 1990, Bonn was the provisional capital ("temporary seat of the Federal institutions") of West Germany, and Germany's present constitution, the Basic Law, was declared in the city in 1949. From 1990 to 1999, Bonn served as the seat of government – but no longer capital – of reunited Germany.

CHAPTER II. ON A MOUNTAIN PATH 

"Armed men, my lords!" had been Fanfulla's cry. "We are betrayed!" 

They looked at one another with stern eyes, and with that grimness that takes the place which fear would hold in meaner souls. 

Then Aquila rose slowly to his feet, and with him rose the others, looking to their weapons. He softly breathed a name--"Masuccio Torri." 

"Aye," cried Lodi bitterly, "would that we had heeded your warning! Masuccio it will be, and at his heels his fifty mercenaries." 

"Not less, I'll swear, by the sound of them," said Ferrabraccio. "And we but six, without our harness." 

"Seven," the Count laconically amended, resuming his hat and loosening his sword in its scabbard. 

"Not so, my lord," exclaimed Lodi, laying a hand upon the Count's arm. "You must not stay with us. You are our only hope--the only hope of Babbiano. If we are indeed betrayed--though by what infernal means I know not--and they have knowledge that six traitors met here to-night to conspire against the throne of Gian Maria, at least, I'll swear, it is not known that you were to have met us. His Highness may conjecture, but he cannot know for sure, and if you but escape, all may yet he well--saving with us, who matter not. Go, my lord! Remember your promise to seek at your cousin's hand the gonfalon, and may God and His blessed Saints prosper your Excellency." 

The old man caught the young man's hand, and bending his head until his face was hidden in his long white hair, he imprinted a kiss of fealty upon it. But Aquila was not so easily to be dismissed.  [Q:] who rose to his feet? [A:] Aquila  [Q:] whose name did he mutter? [A:] "Masuccio Torri."  [Q:] how many men were coming for them? [A:] 50.  [Q:] how many were prepared to defend, including the Count? [A:] Seven.  [Q:] what did Fanfulla cry out? [A:] "Armed men, my lords!  [Q:] what else did he say? [A:] "We are betrayed!"

[Q:] what was he the only hope of? [A:] Babbiano.  [Q:] what were the six men conspiring against? [A:] The throne of Gian Maria.  [Q:] who swore to say that the count hadn't met them? [A:] Lodi.
CHAPTER XVII. 

DEFEAT. 

A grey dimness was creeping in upon the schooner when a little bitter breeze sprang up from westwards, and Dampier bade them get the mainsail on to her. 

"I don't like the look of the weather, and I'm beginning to feel that I'd like to see that boat," he said. "Anyhow, we'll get way on her." 

It was a relief to hoist the mainsail. The work put a little warmth into them, and the white men, at least, had been conscious of a growing uneasiness about their comrades in the boat. The breeze had, however, freshened before they set it, and there were white caps on the water when the _Selache_ headed for the ice. It had somewhat changed its formation when they approached it, for big masses had become detached from it and were moving out into the open water, while the opening had become perceptibly narrower. The light was now fading rapidly, and Wyllard took the wheel when Dampier sent the man there forward. 

"Get the cover off the second boat, and see everything clear for hoisting out," he said to him, and then called to Wyllard. "We're close enough. You'd better heave her round." 

She came round with a thrashing of canvas, stretched out seawards, and came back again with her deck sharply slanted and little puffs of bitter spray blowing over her weather rail, for there was no doubt that the breeze was freshening fast. Then Dampier sent a man up into the foremast shrouds, and looked at Wyllard afterwards.  [Q:] What was heading towards the boat? [A:] a grey dimness  [Q:] What came from the west? [A:] a bitter breeze  [Q:] Who gave some orders? [A:] Dampier  [Q:] What did he want done? [A:] get the mainsail on  [Q:] Did he feel good about the weather? [A:] no  [Q:] What did he want to see?

Multimedia is content that uses a combination of different content forms such as text, audio, images, animations, video and interactive content. Multimedia contrasts with media that use only rudimentary computer displays such as text-only or traditional forms of printed or hand-produced material. 

Multimedia can be recorded and played, displayed, interacted with or accessed by information content processing devices, such as computerized and electronic devices, but can also be part of a live performance. Multimedia devices are electronic media devices used to store and experience multimedia content. Multimedia is distinguished from mixed media in fine art; for example, by including audio it has a broader scope. The term "rich media" is synonymous with interactive multimedia. 

The term "multimedia" was coined by singer and artist Bob Goldstein (later 'Bobb Goldsteinn') to promote the July 1966 opening of his "LightWorks at L'Oursin" show at Southampton, Long Island. Goldstein was perhaps aware of an American artist named Dick Higgins, who had two years previously discussed a new approach to art-making he called "intermedia". 

On August 10, 1966, Richard Albarino of "Variety" borrowed the terminology, reporting: "Brainchild of songscribe-comic Bob ('Washington Square') Goldstein, the 'Lightworks' is the latest "multi-media" music-cum-visuals to debut as discothèque fare." Two years later, in 1968, the term "multimedia" was re-appropriated to describe the work of a political consultant, David Sawyer, the husband of Iris Sawyer—one of Goldstein's producers at L'Oursin. [Q:] What can be recorded and played? [A:] Multimedia  [Q:] What else can it be [A:] interacted with  [Q:] Anything else? [A:] accessed by information content processing devices  [Q:] Who coined the term? [A:] Bob Goldstein  [Q:] When? [A:] July 1966  [Q:] Who is that? [A:] a singer and artist  [Q:] Where was his show? [A:] Southampton, Long Island  [Q:] What was the show called? [A:] "LightWorks at L'Oursin"  [Q:] What is Multimedia?

CHAPTER XXVIII. 

A MEETING. 

About a week after the dissolution of the Crooked Creek Company, Harry was riding over from Hetertown, and had nearly reached the creek on his way home, when he met George Purvis. 

This was their first meeting since their fight, for George had been away on a visit to some relatives in Richmond. 

When Harry saw George riding slowly toward him, he felt very much embarrassed, and very much annoyed because he was embarrassed. 

How should he meet George? What should he say; or should he say anything? 

He did not want to appear anxious to "make up" with him, nor did he want to seem as if he bore malice toward him. If he only knew how George felt about it! 

As it was, he wished he had stopped somewhere on the road. He had thought of stopping at the mill--why had he not? That would just have given George time to pass. 

Both boys appeared to be riding as slowly as their horses would consent to go, and yet when they met, Harry had not half made up his mind what he would say, or how he should say it, or whether it would be better or not to say anything. 

"Hello, George!" said he, quite unpremeditatedly. 

"Hello!" said George, reining in his horse "Where are you going?" 

"Going home," said Harry, also stopping in the road. 

Thus the quarrel came to an end. 

"So you've sold the telegraph?" said George. 

"Yes," said Harry. "And I think we made a pretty good bargain. I didn't think we'd do so well when we started."  [Q:] what company disolved [A:] the Crooked Creek Company  [Q:] who did harry meet [A:] George Purvis.  [Q:] did they have a fight [A:] Yes.

A team of British surgeons has carried out Gaza's first organ transplants for a long-term plan to train local medical staff to perform the operations. 

Two patients underwent kidney transplants at the Shifa, Gaza's biggest public hospital. The operations were conducted a fortnight ago by a volunteer medical team from the Royal Liverpool hospital. 

Ziad Matouk, 42, was born with one kidney and was diagnosed with renal failure several years ago. Matouk, whose wife donated one of her kidneys, hopes to return to his job within six months. The couple had sought a transplant in Cairo, but were rejected as unsuitable at a state hospital and could not afford the fee at a private hospital. "We were desperate," said Matouk. 

The UK-Gaza link-up began about a year ago after Abdelkader Hammad, a doctor at the Royal Liverpool hospital, was contacted by an anaesthetist at the Shifa, who outlined the difficulties the Gaza hospital was facing with dialysis . The Shifa is forced to rely on generators because of power cuts; spare parts for its ageing dialysis machines have been difficult to import; and supplies of consumables are often scarce. After an exploratory trip last April, Hammad---whose family is Palestinian---and three colleagues from Liverpool arrived in Gaza via Egypt last month, bringing specialist equipment. Two patients were selected for surgery. The first, Mohammed Duhair, 42, received a kidney donated by his younger brother in a six-hour operation. Two days later, Matouk received a transplant after his wife, Nadia, 36, was found to be a good match. The surgeon was carried out by the British team, assisted by doctors and nurses from the Shifa. "We are very satisfied with the results," said Sobbi Skaik, head of surgery at the Gaza hospital. 

Skaik hopes that Gaza medical teams will eventually carry out kidney transplants independently, and that other organ transplants may follow. The Shifa is working with the Gaza ministry of health on a plan to train its doctors, surgeons, nursing staff and laboratory technicians in transplant surgery at the Royal Liverpool. "Funding is a problem," said Hammad. "In the meantime we'll go back as volunteers to Gaza for the next couple of years to do more transplants." The Liverpool team's next visit is scheduled for May.

While you are in trouble, what are you going to do? What? Cry? Or escape? Those are all the wrong way! Robinson Crusoe can tell you the right answer! It is an exciting story: Robinson Crusoe hated the comfortable life in his home town. So, he want to be a seaman and travelled around the world. But one day, a terrible thing happened. A great storm came and their boat crashed! No one was alive in this accident except Robinson. He was the luckiest man in the world--Because all his friends were dead but he was alive. However, at the same time he was the most _ man of all--He must face the fact .Alone on an island without food, water or gun!But, all roads lead to Rome!He just used his hands to work hard!Then, he made a cave, built a house, grew corn and kept goats. In the end, he could enjoy the life on the island. In his twenty-fourth year on the island, he saved a wild man, and gave him the name of "Friday". With Robinson's teaching, "Friday" became a good servant. Friday, they got a boat and escaped from the island. Surely, the writer of Robinson Crusoe is really a hero! It's too hard to describe Robinson with words. We could say that Robinson was very clever, and also he was brave,...Certainly, too many good words can describe him. But now, I think it isn't important. However, the most important thing is what we have learned from the story. That is, use our own hands to work hard with confidence! [Q:] Who survived a boat crash?

CHAPTER VI.—LEO ASSERTS HIS RIGHTS. 

At once a crowd of performers surrounded the pair. Very few of them liked Jack Snipper, and they wondered what Leo would do should the gymnast attack the boy. 

“Call me a braggart, will you!” roared Snipper. 

“Don’t you dare to touch me with that club!” replied Leo calmly. 

“I’ll teach you a lesson!” 

And, swinging the Indian club over his head, Jack Snipper made a savage blow at the young gymnast. 

Had the stick struck Leo the boy’s head would have sustained a severe injury. 

But as quick as a flash Leo dodged, and the Indian club merely circled through the empty air. 

“For shame, Snipper!” 

“Do you want to kill the boy?” 

“What harm has he done?” 

And so the cries ran on. 

“Mind your own affairs!” shouted the maddened gymnast. “I’m going to teach the boy a lesson!” 

Again he sprang at Leo. 

But now suddenly the Indian club was caught. A dexterous twist, and it went flying out of reach across the dressing tent. 

Then, before Snipper could recover, he received a stinging slap full in the face that sent him staggering backward on the grass. 

A shout of approval went up. 

“Good for Leo!” 

“That’s right, boy, stand up for your rights!” 

The shout brought Adam Lambert, the general manager, to the scene. 

No sooner had he appeared than all the performers walked away. It was against the rules to fight, and every one present was liable to a heavy fine.  [Q:] which chapter are we reading?

Discogs, short for discographies, is a website and crowdsourced database of information about audio recordings, including commercial releases, promotional releases, and bootleg or off-label releases. The Discogs servers, currently hosted under the domain name discogs.com, are owned by Zink Media, Inc., and are located in Portland, Oregon, US. While the site lists releases in all genres and on all formats, it is especially known as the largest online database of electronic music releases, and of releases on vinyl media. Discogs currently contains over 8 million releases, by nearly 4.9 million artists, across over 1 million labels, contributed from nearly 346,000 contributor user accounts—with these figures constantly growing as users continually add previously unlisted releases to the site over time. 

The discogs.com domain name was registered on 30 August 2000, and Discogs itself was launched in November 2000 by programmer, DJ, and music fan Kevin Lewandowski originally as a database of electronic music. 

He was inspired by the success of community-built sites such as Slashdot, eBay, and Open Directory Project, and decided to use this model for a music discography database. 

The site's original goal was to build the most comprehensive database of electronic music, organized around the artists, labels, and releases available in that genre. In 2003 the Discogs system was completely rewritten, and in January 2004 it began to support other genres, starting with hip hop. Since then, it has expanded to include rock and jazz in January 2005 and funk/soul, Latin, and reggae in October of the same year. In January 2006 blues and non-music (e.g. comedy records, field recordings, interviews) were added. Classical music started being supported in June 2007, and in October 2007 the "final genres were turned on" – adding support for the Stage & Screen, Brass & Military, Children's, and Folk, World, & Country music genres, allowing capture of virtually every single type of audio recording that has ever been released.

Zen () is a school of Mahayana Buddhism that originated in China during the Tang dynasty as Chan Buddhism. Zen school was strongly influenced by Taoism and developed as a distinct school of Chinese Buddhism. From China, Chan Buddhism spread south to Vietnam, northeast to Korea and east to Japan, where it became known as Japanese Zen. 

The term Zen is derived from the Japanese pronunciation of the Middle Chinese word 禪 (Chan) which traces its roots to the Indian practice of Dhyana ("meditation"). Zen emphasizes rigorous self-control, meditation-practice, insight into Buddha-nature, and the personal expression of this insight in daily life, especially for the benefit of others. As such, it de-emphasizes mere knowledge of sutras and doctrine and favors direct understanding through zazen and interaction with an accomplished teacher. 

The teachings of Zen include various sources of Mahayana thought, especially Yogachara, the Tathāgatagarbha sūtras and the Huayan school, with their emphasis on Buddha-nature, totality, and the Bodhisattva-ideal. The Prajñāpāramitā literature and, to a lesser extent, Madhyamaka have also been influential in the shaping of the "paradoxical language" of the Zen-tradition. 

The word "Zen" is derived from the Japanese pronunciation of the Middle Chinese word 禪 () (pinyin: "Chán"), which in turn is derived from the Sanskrit word "dhyāna" (ध्यान ), which can be approximately translated as "absorption" or "meditative state". [Q:] Zen is part of which religion? [A:] Buddhism  [Q:] What is it a school of? [A:] Mahayana Buddhism  [Q:] Where did that type come from? [A:] China  [Q:] When? [A:] During the Tang dynasty  [Q:] What influenced Zen? [A:] Taoism  [Q:] Name a country to which it spread from China. [A:] Japan  [Q:] Name something the teachings of Zen emphasizes.

CHAPTER III. THE ROMAN BARONS 

Having driven Charles VIII out of Italy, it still remained for the allies to remove all traces of his passage from Naples and to restore the rule of the House of Aragon. In this they had the aid of Ferdinand and Isabella, who sent an army under the command of that distinguished soldier Gonzalo de Cordoba, known in his day as the Great Captain. 

He landed in Calabria in the spring of 1496, and war broke out afresh through that already sorely devastated land. The Spaniards were joined by the allied forces of Venice and the Church under the condotta of the Marquis Gonzaga of Mantua, the leader of the Italians at Fornovo. 

Lodovico had detached himself from the league, and again made terms with France for his own safety's sake. But his cousin, Giovanni Sforza, Tyrant of Pesaro--the husband of Lucrezia Borgia--continued in the pontifical army at the head of a condotta of 600 lances. Another command in the same ranks was one of 700 lances under the youthful Giuffredo Borgia, now Prince of Squillace and the husband of Doña Sancia of Aragon, a lady of exceedingly loose morals, who had brought to Rome the habits acquired in the most licentious Court of that licentious age. 

The French lost Naples even more easily than they had conquered it, and by July 7 Ferdinand II was able to reenter his capital and reascend his throne. D'Aubigny, the French general, withdrew to France, whilst Montpensier, the Viceroy, retired to Pozzuoli, where he died in the following year.  [Q:] who was driven out of Italy?

(CNN) -- Before she was a princess, she was a child - shy but affectionate, respectful but mischievous. 

Diana Spencer, shown on her first birthday, grew up at Park House, a country estate leased from the royal family. 

Ten years after the death of Princess Diana, two women who helped raise the future princess are providing a new, intimate portrait of the girl who would become the "People's Princess." 

Diana Frances Spencer was born into a life of privilege. She grew up at Park House, a country home leased from the royal family's Sandringham estate in Norfolk, England. Her parents, Johnnie and Frances Spencer, were well-known members of the English aristocracy. 

Inge Crane came to Park House as an au pair when Diana was just 3 years old. 

"There's always been something special about Park House. It's difficult to put a finger on what it is," she said in her first interview, given exclusively to CNN. 

Life at the house wasn't entirely normal -- the queen's estate was about a mile away, and the young Princes Andrew and Edward (Diana's future in-laws) frequently visited to swim in the pool. 

When the butler would ring the gong for dinner, the children would rush to the stairs, slide down the wooden banister and run into the dining room. 

Despite growing up in the shadows of royalty, Crane and Mary Clarke, Diana's nanny starting at age 9, describe an "ordinary" childhood for Diana, a tomboy who loved going outdoors, climbing trees and playing with animals.  [Q:] where did Princess Diana grow up? [A:] at Park House  [Q:] in what city? [A:] in Norfolk  [Q:] did her family own it? [A:] no  [Q:] whose house was it?

Janet walked past the barn, the big tree, and through the back yard to reach the chicken pen. Janet gathered the eggs from the chicken pen, so that her father could make scrambled eggs for breakfast. He would need at least 5 eggs for the meal, two for Janet and three for himself. Janet could only find four eggs in the chicken pen. She looked under every chicken, and in every nest, but could not find another egg. She placed the four eggs in her basket, and began to walk toward the house, when she heard a quacking sound. She went toward the sound and found a nest near the pond, with large brown eggs inside. "Quack" said a nearby duck, as Janet took an egg from the nest. Now she had enough for breakfast.

CHAPTER XXIX 

A QUESTION OF TITLE 

It was as if each person who had doubted Sam's honesty felt it necessary to call at Mrs. Byram's and congratulate him upon what now appeared to be good proof of his innocence. 

Fred and the miners also came in for their share of attention, and even Bill, whose limb was paining him severely, joined his partners in celebrating their victory, which now seemed certain. 

Before returning home Mr. Hunter called to consult with his clients relative to making a stock company of the new mine, and, when he left, it was with full authority to do whatever he believed their interests demanded. 

Among the visitors in the evening was Donovan, and he had no hesitation in calling himself very severe names for having been so stupid as to think it possible his old friends could have been engaged in any questionable transaction. 

"The cashier is about as sore a man as can be found in town," he said, "an' if I ain't way off in my reckonin' he'll be lookin' for another job mighty soon." 

"Does he say anything against us?" Bill asked. 

"He's glum as a fish. Every feller who goes in wants to know where Gus is, an' he keeps out of sight all that's possible." 

"Have you seen Mr. Wright to-day?" 

"No; but I heard he an' that lawyer of yours had a long chin about the business. Say, Bill, by the time you get out of this scrape you'll owe a pretty penny for law, I reckon. Why don't you try to make the company pay it?"  [Q:] Who was a visitor in the evening? [A:] Donovan  [Q:] Did he hesitate? [A:] no  [Q:] What did he call himself? [A:] very severe names  [Q:] Why?

GERALD Christian is in Grade 8 at Ridge Road Middle School in North Carolina, US. She is a member of her school basketball team. Late last month, the 14-year-old faced a big problem. Her mother lost her job. She thought she couldn't pay the $ 50 fee for the city's sports meet this year. Christian was not the only one who had this problem. Some other middle school players in the city had the same problem. That's why famous NBA player Michael Jordan gave $ 250, 000 to the city earlier this month. He wanted to help the poor students. Jordan said: "I know there are kids who get an education by playing sports. We need to keep sports alive for them." Christian was _ . "Really? I can't believe Michael did that for us. These days, I go to bed thinking about it and I wake up thinking about it," she said. "Now the problem is over. " Christian wanted to say "thanks" to Jordan.

(Entertainment Weekly) -- How are the elements of the charming, traditional romantic comedy "The Proposal" like the checklist of a charming, traditional bride? Let me count the ways ... 

Ryan Reynolds wonders if marrying his boss, Sandra Bullock, is a good thing in "The Proposal." 

Something old: The story of a haughty woman and an exasperated man who hate each other -- until they realize they love each other -- is proudly square, in the tradition of rom-coms from the 1940s and '50s. Or is it straight out of Shakespeare's 1590s? 

Sandra Bullock is the shrew, Margaret, a pitiless, high-powered New York book editor first seen multitasking in the midst of her aerobic workout (thus you know she needs to get ... loved). Ryan Reynolds is Andrew, her put-upon foil of an executive assistant, a younger man who accepts abuse as a media-industry hazing ritual. 

And there the two would remain, locked in mutual disdain, except for Margaret's fatal flaw -- she's Canadian. (So is "X-Men's" Wolverine; I thought our neighbors to the north were supposed to be nice.) 

Margaret, with her visa expired, faces deportation and makes the snap executive decision to marry Andrew in a green-card wedding. It's an offer the underling can't refuse if he wants to keep his job. (A sexual-harassment lawsuit would ruin the movie's mood.) 

OK, he says. But first comes a visit to the groom-to-be's family in Alaska. Amusing complications ensue. 

Something new: The chemical energy between Bullock and Reynolds is fresh and irresistible. In her mid-40s, Bullock has finessed her dewy America's Sweetheart comedy skills to a mature, pearly texture; she's lovable both as an uptight careerist in a pencil skirt and stilettos, and as a lonely lady in a flapping plaid bathrobe.  [Q:] What movie is the article referring to? [A:] The Proposal  [Q:] What type of film is it? [A:] romantic comedy  [Q:] What comparison does the article attempt to make? [A:] How the elements of the comedy are like the checklist of a charming, traditional bride?  [Q:] Who are the 2 main actors/actresses in the film?

Height above average terrain (HAAT) (or less popularly, EHAAT, Effective Height Above Average Terrain) is a measure of how high an antenna site is above the surrounding landscape. HAAT is used extensively in FM radio and television, as it is more important than effective radiated power (ERP) in determining the range of broadcasts (VHF and UHF in particular, as they are line of sight transmissions). For international coordination, it is officially measured in meters, even by the Federal Communications Commission in the United States, as Canada and Mexico have extensive border zones where stations can be received on either side of the international boundaries. Stations that want to increase above a certain HAAT must reduce their power accordingly, based on the maximum distance their station class is allowed to cover (see List of North American broadcast station classes for more information on this). 

The FCC procedure to calculate HAAT is: from the proposed or actual antenna site, either 12 or 16 radials were drawn, and points at 2, 4, 6, 8, and radius along each radial were used. The entire radial graph could be rotated to achieve the best effect for the station. The altitude of the antenna site, minus the average altitude of all the specified points, is the HAAT. This can create some unusual cases, particularly in mountainous regions—it is possible to have a negative number for HAAT (the transmitter would not be located underground, but rather in a valley, with hills on both sides taller than the transmitter itself, for example). [Q:] What does HAAT stand for? [A:] It stands for Height about average terrain  [Q:] What is a similar acronym that means the same thing? [A:] The less popular version, EHAAT, Effective Height Above Average Terrain  [Q:] Can it be a negative number? [A:] Yes  [Q:] Where does that happen? [A:] Usually in the mountainous regions  [Q:] What industries is it used in? [A:] More commonly, FM radio and television  [Q:] What transmission types? [A:] Usually VHF and UHF  [Q:] Is it given in feet? [A:] NO  [Q:] What unit is used? [A:] Meters  [Q:] Why? [A:] So that stations can be recieved on either side of the international boundaries.  [Q:] What is subtracted from what to find it? [A:] average altitude
Fort Lauderdale, Florida (CNN) -- Just taking a sip of water or walking to the bathroom is excruciatingly painful for 15-year-old Michael Brewer, who was burned over 65 percent of his body after being set on fire, allegedly by a group of teenagers. 

"It hurts my heart to see him in pain, but it enlightens at the same time to know my son is strong enough to make it through on a daily basis," his mother, Valerie Brewer, told CNN on Wednesday. 

Brewer and her husband, Michael Brewer, Sr., spoke to CNN's Tony Harris, a day after a 13-year-old boy who witnessed last month's attack publicly read a written statement: 

"I want to express my deepest sympathy to Mikey and his family," Jeremy Jarvis said. "I will pray for Mikey to grow stronger every day and for Mikey's speedy recovery." 

Jarvis' older brother has been charged in the October 12 attack in Deerfield Beach, Florida. 

When asked about the teen's statement, Valerie Brewer -- who knows the Jarvis family -- said she "can't focus on that." 

"I would really like to stay away from that because that brings negative energy to me and I don't need that right now," she said. 

Her son remains in guarded condition at the University of Miami's Jackson Memorial Hospital Burn Center. He suffered second- and third-degree burns over about two-thirds of his body, according to the hospital's associate director, Dr. Carl Schulman. 

The teen faces a lifelong recovery from his injuries, Schulman told CNN's Harris.  [Q:] What is the subject of the story? [A:] Michael Brewer  [Q:] What happened to him? [A:] He was burned  [Q:] How badly? [A:] over 65% of his body  [Q:] Do we know who caused the burns? [A:] Yes  [Q:] Who was that? [A:] Jeremy Jarvis' older brother.  [Q:] Is the victim still in the hospital? [A:] Yes  [Q:] How long before he recovers from his injury? [A:] He has a lifelong recoery.  [Q:] Who spoke to Tony Harris? [A:] Valerie Brewer and her husband Michael Brewer, Sr.  [Q:] Are they related to the victim? [A:] Yes  [Q:] How so? [A:] His parents.  [Q:] What news agency does Tony work for?

[A:] Jeremy Jarvis  [Q:] What does the mother claim to not need right now? [A:] Negative energy
Paris (CNN) -- French officials Tuesday condemned an Israeli airstrike on Gaza that wounded its consul, his wife and their daughter, calling on Israel to avoid civilian casualties. 

"France strongly deplores the consequences of this air strike," a statement from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Paris announced. "While France is committed to security in Israel, it reaffirms the imperative need to avoid attacks on civilians. This imperative was reaffirmed to the Israeli authorities." 

The consul, Majdi Shakoura, was at home with his family in the northern end of Gaza when the airstrike hit about 200 meters (650 feet) away, the Foreign Ministry said. The strike blew out their windows, and they were struck by shards of flying glass, the ministry said. 

Capt. Aryeh Shalikar, an Israeli military spokesman, told CNN the airstrike was aimed at Palestinian militants who fired a rocket into southern Israel late Sunday. Shalikar said the Israel Defense Forces "never received any official statement from any source" regarding injuries to Shakoura or his relatives. 

"The IDF wishes to convey that missiles are being fired at Israeli civilians from terrorists, and it has no intention of harming civilians when it returns fire at terrorists," he said. 

Palestinian security and medical officials said one person died and several others were wounded in the airstrike, which they said struck a Hamas naval building in northern Gaza. A Hamas security official said two Israeli rockets struck the building. 

France has a consulate and a cultural center in Gaza "to support the population," the Foreign Ministry said. France has helped build water and sewer systems and rebuild hospitals in Gaza, which is ruled by the Islamic movement Hamas.  [Q:] Which official condemned the airstrike? [A:] French officials  [Q:] Which consul was hit? [A:] Majdi Shakoura  [Q:] How far away was their home hit? [A:] hit about 200 meters (650 feet) away  [Q:] Who was the airstrike aimed at?

Windows 8 introduced major changes to the operating system's platform and user interface to improve its user experience on tablets, where Windows was now competing with mobile operating systems, including Android and iOS. In particular, these changes included a touch-optimized Windows shell based on Microsoft's "Metro" design language, the Start screen (which displays programs and dynamically updated content on a grid of tiles), a new platform for developing apps with an emphasis on touchscreen input, integration with online services (including the ability to sync apps and settings between devices), and Windows Store, an online store for downloading and purchasing new software. Windows 8 added support for USB 3.0, Advanced Format hard drives, near field communications, and cloud computing. Additional security features were introduced, such as built-in antivirus software, integration with Microsoft SmartScreen phishing filtering service and support for UEFI Secure Boot on supported devices with UEFI firmware, to prevent malware from infecting the boot process.

(CNN)The widow of the man whose life was portrayed in the acclaimed film "American Sniper" has penned a heartfelt letter to him on their 13th anniversary. 

Taya Kyle posted her letter March 16 on the Chris Kyle Facebook page, where she proclaimed, "I miss you and I love you. I feel you in my heart and soul so strongly. I am more blessed to have been your wife than anything else in my life." 

"Today, I have a choice. I can bury myself under the covers and acknowledge the pain of missing you and mourn the future anniversaries without you," she wrote. "Or, I can celebrate never having a day without you in my heart because you loved me enough to leave me a lifetime of memories and beauty." 

Kyle, a Navy SEAL, has been credited as the most successful sniper in United States military history. Bradley Cooper was nominated for an Academy Award for his portrayal of Kyle in this winter's film "American Sniper," which was based on Kyle's bestselling autobiography. 

The film, directed by Clint Eastwood, has become the highest-grossing war movie ever. 

Why 'American Sniper' is a smash hit 

Kyle and his friend Chad Littlefield were shot and killed at a gun range in 2013 by Eddie Ray Routh. A Texas jury found Routh guilty of capital murder in February, and he was sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole.

Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo find themselves fighting it out for FIFA's Ballon d'Or award once again -- but the contest between the world's two highest-profile footballers isn't only being played out on the pitch. 

Bayern Munich's German international goalkeeper Manuel Neuer was the other player on the three-man shortlist revealed Monday, with Ronaldo the overwhelming favorite to take the award. 

Which means there is no sign of Barcelona's Messi and Real Madrid poster boy Ronaldo's domination of the back pages ending any time soon. 

Both are so globally known that that their every Facebook posting is worth thousands of dollars for brands associated with the two players, while the allure of their names helps shift any and every product with which they are associated. 

But who is the most marketable? 

Is it Messi, the newly-crowned all-time La Liga top scorer? Or is it Ronaldo, the current Ballon d'Or holder and a man seemingly able to score goals at will, no matter what the competition? 

Sports marketing research company Repucom examined 15 different markets, ranging from Spain to the U.S., and found that Portugal skipper Ronaldo is the better-known of the two: 92% know of him, while 87% have heard of Messi. 

The figures also show that the same number of men know about Messi as women know about Ronaldo -- 91%. 

They reveal that Ronaldo sells more effectively, with 86% of those questioned regarding the ex-Manchester United man as "an influential brand spokesman." 

"Cristiano Ronaldo dominates in terms of his overall marketability -- largely because of the consistently high levels of awareness people have of him around the world, whilst Messi has a greater proportion of people that do know of him saying they like him," said Repucom's global head of research Mike Wragg.

Anthropology is the study of humans and their societies in the past and present. Its main subdivisions are social anthropology and cultural anthropology, which describes the workings of societies around the world, linguistic anthropology, which investigates the influence of language in social life, and biological or physical anthropology, which concerns long-term development of the human organism. Archaeology, which studies past human cultures through investigation of physical evidence, is thought of as a branch of anthropology in the United States, while in Europe, it is viewed as a discipline in its own right, or grouped under other related disciplines such as history. 

Similar organizations in other countries followed: The American Anthropological Association in 1902, the Anthropological Society of Madrid (1865), the Anthropological Society of Vienna (1870), the Italian Society of Anthropology and Ethnology (1871), and many others subsequently. The majority of these were evolutionist. One notable exception was the Berlin Society of Anthropology (1869) founded by Rudolph Virchow, known for his vituperative attacks on the evolutionists. Not religious himself, he insisted that Darwin's conclusions lacked empirical foundation. [Q:] Who disagreed with Darwin? [A:] Rudolph Virchow  [Q:] What did he found? [A:] the Berlin Society of Anthropology  [Q:] In what year? [A:] 1869  [Q:] What was founded in 1865? [A:] the Anthropological Society of Madrid (1865)  [Q:] And in 1870?

It's finally the weekend of Halloween and I get to dress up in my lion costume. Halloween is my favorite holiday because I really like candy and love dressing up. Last year I was a ghost, but this year I am a lion. My little brother is dressed like a dinosaur and he keeps chewing on everything. He is only 3 years old so I guess that is okay. His name is Todd and his favorite holiday is his birthday but I don't think he knows much about any of them. My dad loves Christmas and my Mom really likes Thanksgiving. But I love Halloween. We have to wait for my dad to come home from work so we can go out and trick-or-treat. While we are waiting my mommy cooks us dinner. She wants us to eat good food before we spoil our dinner with all the candy we are going to get. I can't wait to go to my friend Kevin's house. His parents give the best candy and give me extra since Kevin is my friend. I think Kevin said he was going to dress up like a pirate but I don't remember.

Billy went to the farm to buy some beef for his brother's birthday. When he arrived there he saw that all six of the cows were sad and had brown spots. The cows were all eating their breakfast in a big grassy meadow. He thought that the spots looked very strange so he went closer to the cows to get a better look. When he got closer he also saw that there were five white chickens sitting on the fence. The fence was painted blue and had some dirty black spots on it. Billy wondered where the dirty spots had come. Soon he got close to the chickens and they got scared. All five chickens flew away and went to eat some food. After Billy got a good look at the cows he went to the farmer to buy some beef. The farmer gave him four pounds of beef for ten dollars.

(EW.com ) -- When last we saw Olivia Pope, she was flying off into the sunset (or maybe just flying off) with Jake by her sideâ€”leaving behind a broken Fitz, who'd just lost his son and realized some horrible things about his father.

CHAPTER XX 

A BLIZZARD 

A bitter wind searched the poplar bluff where George and his hired man, Grierson, were cutting fuel. Except in the river valleys, trees of any size are scarce on the prairie, but the slender trunks and leafless branches were closely massed and afforded a little shelter. Outside on the open waste, the cold was almost too severe to face, and George once or twice glanced anxiously across the snowy levels, looking for some sign of Edgar, who should have joined them with the team and sledge. It was, however, difficult to see far, because a gray dimness narrowed in the horizon. George stood, dressed in snow-flecked furs, in the center of a little clearing strewn with rows of fallen trunks from which he was hewing off the branches. The work was hard; his whole body strained with each stroke of the heavy ax, but it failed to keep him warm, and the wind was growing more bitter with the approach of night. 

"I don't know what can be keeping West," he said after a while. "We haven't seen the mail-carrier either, and he's two hours late; but he must have had a heavy trail all the way from the settlement. I expect he'll cut out our place and make straight for Grant's. We'll have snow before long." 

There was an empty shack not far away where, by George's consent, the mail-carrier left letters when bad weather made it desirable to shorten his round. 

Grierson nodded as he glanced about. The stretch of desolate white prairie had contracted since he had last noticed it, the surrounding dimness was creeping nearer in, and the ranks of poplar trunks were losing their sharpness of form. Now that the men had ceased chopping, they could hear the eerie moaning of the wind and the sharp patter of icy snow-dust among the withered brush.  [Q:] Who were they waiting for? [A:] Edgar  [Q:] Who else? [A:] West  [Q:] Who was two hours late? [A:] the mail-carrier  [Q:] Where would the carrier go after leaving them? [A:] Grant's  [Q:] How was the weather? [A:] very cold  [Q:] What was the employee's name? [A:] Grierson  [Q:] Who was his boss? [A:] George  [Q:] What were they doing? [A:] cutting fuel  [Q:] Are trees bountiful in that region? [A:] no  [Q:] Was this an easy job? [A:] no  [Q:] What would they cut with? [A:] an ax  [Q:] What was approaching? [A:] the surrounding dimness  [Q:] What time of day was it becoming? [A:] night  [Q:] And what had stopped? [A:] the men's chopping
CHAPTER VIII. BRUCE AND THE WAR OF INDEPENDENCE. 

The position towards France of Edward I. made it really more desirable for him that Scotland should be independent and friendly, than half subdued and hostile to his rule. While she was hostile, England, in attacking France, always left an enemy in her rear. But Edward supposed that by clemency to all the Scottish leaders except Wallace, by giving them great appointments and trusting them fully, and by calling them to his Parliament in London, he could combine England and Scotland in affectionate union. He repaired the ruins of war in Scotland; he began to study her laws and customs; he hastily ran up for her a new constitution, and appointed his nephew, John of Brittany, as governor. But he had overlooked two facts: the Scottish clergy, from the highest to the lowest, were irreconcilably opposed to union with England; and the greatest and most warlike of the Scottish nobles, if not patriotic, were fickle and insatiably ambitious. It is hard to reckon how often Robert Bruce had turned his coat, and how often the Bishop of St Andrews had taken the oath to Edward. Both men were in Edward's favour in June 1304, but in that month they made against him a treasonable secret covenant. Through 1305 Bruce prospered in Edward's service, on February 10, 1306, Edward was conferring on him a new favour, little guessing that Bruce, after some negotiation with his old rival, the Red Comyn, had slain him (an uncle of his was also butchered) before the high altar of the Church of the Franciscans in Dumfries. Apparently Bruce had tried to enlist Comyn in his conspiracy, and had found him recalcitrant, or feared that he would be treacherous (February 10, 1306).

Luna the hawk wanted some socks. It was the middle of winter and sitting on tree branches made her feet very cold. Luna hoped that her friends could help her find some socks. She flew to the old maple tree where Olive the owl lived. 

"Olive, may I please borrow a pair of your socks?" she asked. 

Olive the owl looked surprised. "Luna, I have no use for socks because my legs and toes have thick feathers. Go visit one of the animals that walk on four legs. They might have extra socks you could borrow." 

Luna flew across the field and landed next to the icy creek. Rose the raccoon was teaching her six babies how to wash their paws. The water was very cold, but the babies were having fun. 

"Rose, my bare legs and bare toes are so cold, may I please borrow a pair of your socks?" begged Luna. 

Rose laughed hard. "Silly Luna, I do not have socks. Look at my legs and feet. They are covered with thick, warm fur. I'm sorry I cannot help you. Go visit the humans. Sometimes I tip over their garbage cans at night when I am looking for food. Once I saw a pair of socks." 

Luna was very afraid of humans. Her grandmother and mother had warned her about them. She was told that some humans are mean and hurt hawks. Her feet were so cold that it was difficult to grip tree branches. She became brave. She flew to the farmhouse on the big hill. When she landed on the roof, she could not believe her eyes. She saw socks! In late autumn, Henrietta the human had put laundry outside to dry and she had forgotten to bring in one tiny pair of socks. The socks were hanging on the clothesline by two wooden pins. Luna used her powerful beak to break the pins. She put on the socks and then flew back to her home in the huge tree. When she landed, her feet were warm and dry. Luna was very happy. [Q:] What season was it? [A:] winter  [Q:] What did Luna need? [A:] socks  [Q:] Who did she first ask for socks?

[A:] on the clothesline  [Q:] Who put the socks there? [A:] Henrietta the human  [Q:] What did Luna use to break the clothes pins? [A:] her beak  [Q:] How did she feel when she returned home? [A:] happy.
When my father was dying, I traveled a thousand miles from home to be with him in his last days. It was far more heartbreaking than I'd expected, one of the most difficult and painful times in my life. After he passed away I stayed alone in his apartment. There were so many things to deal with. It all seemed endless. I was lonely. I hated the silence of the apartment. 

But one evening the silence was broken: I heard crying outside. I opened the door to find a little cat on the steps. He was thin and poor. He looked the way I felt. I brought him inside and gave him a can of fish. He ate it and then almost immediately fell sound asleep. 

The next morning I checked with neighbors and learned that the cat had been abandoned by his owner who's moved out. So the little cat was there all alone, just like I was. As I walked back to the apartment, I tried to figure out what to do with him. Having something else to take care of seemed _ But as soon as I opened the apartment door he came running and jumped into my arms. It was clear from that moment that he had no intention of going anywhere. I started calling him Willis, in honor of my father's best friend. 

From then on, things grew easier. With Willis in my lap time seemed to pass much more quickly. When the time finally came for me to return home I had to decide what to do about Willis. There was absolutely no way I would leave without him. 

It's now been five years since my father died. Over the years, several people have commented on how nice it was of me to rescue the cat. But I know that we rescued each other. I may have given him a home but he gave me something greater. [Q:] What was crying? [A:] a cat  [Q:] what did the author feed it? [A:] yes  [Q:] what did the author feed it?

[A:] no  [Q:] how did the author feel after his dad died? [A:] heartbroken  [Q:] did he expect it? [A:] no  [Q:] what did people say to him about Willis?

Slovenia, officially the Republic of Slovenia (Slovene: , abbr.: "RS"), is a nation state located in the southern Central Europe, variously classified as part of Eastern and Southern Europe. The country is located at the crossroads of main European cultural and trade routes. It is bordered by Italy to the west, Austria to the north, Hungary to the northeast, Croatia to the south and southeast, and the Adriatic Sea to the southwest. It covers and has a population of 2.06 million. It is a parliamentary republic and a member of the United Nations, European Union, and NATO. The capital and largest city is Ljubljana. 

The territory is mostly mountainous with a mainly continental climate, with the exception of the Slovene Littoral that has a sub-Mediterranean climate and the north-western area that has an Alpine climate. Additionally, the Dinaric Alps and the Pannonian Plain meet on the territory of Slovenia. The country, marked by a significant biological diversity, is one of the most water-rich in Europe, with a dense river network, a rich aquifer system, and significant karst underground watercourses. Over half of the territory is covered by forest. The human settlement of Slovenia is dispersed and uneven. 

Slovenia has historically been the crossroads of West Slavic, South Slavic, Germanic, Romance, and Hungarian languages and culture. Although the population is not homogeneous, the majority is Slovene. South Slavic language Slovene is the official language throughout the country. Slovenia is a largely secularized country, but its culture and identity have been significantly influenced by Catholicism as well as Lutheranism. The economy of Slovenia is small, open, and export-oriented and has been strongly influenced by international conditions. It has been severely hurt by the Eurozone crisis, started in the late 2000s. The main economic field is services, followed by industry and construction. [Q:] what nation has Ljublijana as the capital? [A:] Slovenia  [Q:] what's the official name?

CHAPTER XII. TRANSFORMATION 



'Well, now for the second stage of our guardianship!' said Aunt Ada, as the two sisters sat over the fire after Valetta had gone to bed. 'Fergus comes back to-morrow, and Gillian---when?' 

'She does not seem quite certain, for there is to be a day or two at Brompton with this delightful Geraldine, so that she may see her grandmother---also Mr. Clement Underwood's church, and the Merchant of Venice---an odd mixture of ecclesiastics and dissipations.' 

'I wonder whether she will be set up by it.' 

'So do I! They are all remarkably good people; but then good people do sometimes spoil the most of all, for they are too unselfish to snub. And on the other hand, seeing the world sometimes has the wholesome effect of making one feel small---' 

'My dear Jenny!' 

'Oh! I did not mean you, who are never easily effaced; but I was thinking of youthful bumptiousness, fostered by country life and elder sistership.' 

'Certainly, though Valetta is really much improved, Gillian has not been as pleasant as I expected, especially during the latter part of the time.' 

'Query, was it her fault or mine, or the worry of the examination, or all three?' 

'Perhaps you did superintend a little too much at first. More than modern independence was prepared for, though I should not have expected recalcitration in a young Lily; but I think there was more ruffling of temper and more reserve than I can quite understand.' 

'It has not been a success. As dear old Lily would have said, "My dream has vanished," of a friend in the younger generation, and now it remains to do the best I can for her in the few weeks that are left, before we have her dear mother again.'  [Q:] Who were sitting over the fire? [A:] the two sisters  [Q:] Who had gone to bed? [A:] Valetta  [Q:] Who is coming back tomorrow? [A:] Fergus  [Q:] Where is Gillian spending a day or two? [A:] Brompton  [Q:] who does she want to see there? [A:] her grandmother  [Q:] Do they think they're bad people? [A:] no  [Q:] Has Gillian been pleasant? [A:] no  [Q:] especially when? [A:] the latter part of the time  [Q:] Is Lily old? [A:] no  [Q:] Is there anger? [A:] yes
CHAPTER V--CLIPSTONE FRIENDS 



"What idle progeny succeed To chase the rolling circle's speed, Or urge the flying ball."--GRAY. 

The afternoon at Clipstone was a success. Gillian was at home, and every one found congeners. Lady Merrifield's sister, Miss Mohun, pounced upon Miss Prescott as a coadjutor in the alphabet of good works needed in the neglected district of Arnscombe, where Mr. Earl was wifeless, and the farm ladies heedless; but they were interrupted by Mysie running up to claim Miss Prescott for a game at croquet. "Uncle Redgie was so glad to see the hoops come into fashion again," and Vera and Paula hardly knew the game, they had always played at lawn tennis; but they were delighted to learn, for Uncle Redgie proved to be a very fine-looking retired General, and there was a lad besides, grown to manly height; and one boy, at home for Easter, who, caring not for croquet, went with Primrose to exhibit to Thekla the tame menagerie, where a mungoose, called of course Raki raki, was the last acquisition. She was also shown the kittens of the beloved Begum, and presented with Phoebus, a tabby with a wise face and a head marked like a Greek lyre, to be transplanted to the Goyle in due time. 

"If Sister will let me have it," said Thekla. 

"Of course she will," said Primrose. "Mysie says she is so jolly." 

"Dear me! all the girls at our school said she was a regular Old Maid."

(CNN) -- American journalist Michael Scott Moore, held for more than two years by Somali pirates, has been freed, Moore's family and a Somali official told CNN on Tuesday. 

"We are just elated," Marlis Saunders, Moore's mother, said in a brief conversation. "It took a lot of work for us to get this point. And to hear he is free -- just joyful, I can't describe it." 

"All this is just so new," said Saunders, who lives in Redondo Beach, California. "I did not have much time to talk with him. We just have a lot of things to do and I cannot talk anymore. We need a little time to evaluate all this." 

The governor of Somalia's Mudug region, Ahmed Muse, told CNN that local elders negotiated Moore's release, adding that the journalist is "physically and mentally" worn out. 

Moore boarded a plane at an airport in Galkayo, in the north-central part of Somalia, Muse said. 

Muse would not say where the journalist is headed. 

"I'm absolutely thrilled," said Michel Todd, who was Moore's web editor at Pacific Standard magazine. "It's like seeing somebody come back from the dead. It's a marvelous resurrection." 

Todd said Moore was a weekly freelance columnist who wrote often about Somalia. He had been researching Somali pirates. 

"As a news organization, we wanted to write about his capture," Todd said. "But we had been encouraged by the FBI and State Department to (not) write about it because this would hurt his cause. They said, if you really care about the guy, that is not a good idea, raising his profile would make his release more difficult."  [Q:] Who had 2 years of being held? [A:] Michael Scott Moore  [Q:] what happened to him? [A:] freed  [Q:] from who? [A:] Somali pirates  [Q:] after how long? [A:] more than two years  [Q:] Did anyone feel about this? [A:] Yes  [Q:] who? [A:] Marlis Saunders  [Q:] who was that? [A:] Moore's mother  [Q:] how did she feel? [A:] elated  [Q:] why? [A:] to hear he is free  [Q:] how does she describe it? [A:] She can't.
Once upon a time there was a boy monster named Jerry who lived in a train car at the railroad tracks. He had lived there all his life. Jerry's mother was named Marge, and she was 36. Marge raised Jerry at the railroad tracks because she wanted to keep him safe. She was afraid of the people who lived in the town nearby. The town was named Qarth, and 100 people lived there. Marge believed that the people of Qarth would attack them if they knew they were there. Qarth used to be filled with factories when Jerry was born. By the time Jerry was a teenager, most of the factories had gone away and most of the people worked on special new machines. They ate food from the fields outside of town. Their favorite food to eat was a special kind of corn. They didn't eat meat because nobody raised any farm animals. One day when he was 11, Jerry asked his mother who his father had been. His father's name was George, and he was 2 years older than Marge. Marge looked sad and told Jerry that George had left after he was born because the people in the town didn't like him. This made Jerry very sad. He went off to his corner of the car and didn't talk to Marge again until she went to bed. After she fell asleep he wanted to go out and look for his father. He packed some food and left. When Marge woke up she was upset, but she thought she knew where he had gone. [Q:] What was the boy monster's name? [A:] Jerry  [Q:] Where did he live?

Endemism is the ecological state of a species being unique to a defined geographic location, such as an island, nation, country or other defined zone, or habitat type; organisms that are indigenous to a place are not endemic to it if they are also found elsewhere. The extreme opposite of endemism is cosmopolitan distribution. An alternative term for a species that is endemic is precinctive, which applies to species (and subspecific categories) that are restricted to a defined geographical area. 

The word "endemic" is from New Latin "endēmicus", from Greek ενδήμος, "endēmos", "native". "Endēmos" is formed of "en" meaning "in", and "dēmos" meaning "the people". The term "precinctive" has been suggested by some scientists, and was first used in botany by MacCaughey in 1917. It is the equivalent of "endemism". "Precinction" was perhaps first used by Frank and McCoy. "Precinctive" seems to have been coined by David Sharp when describing the Hawaiian fauna in 1900: "I use the word precinctive in the sense of 'confined to the area under discussion' ... 'precinctive forms' means those forms that are confined to the area specified." That definition excludes artificial confinement of examples by humans in far-off botanical gardens or zoological parks. 

Physical, climatic, and biological factors can contribute to endemism. The orange-breasted sunbird is exclusively found in the fynbos vegetation zone of southwestern South Africa. The glacier bear is found only in limited places in Southeast Alaska. Political factors can play a part if a species is protected, or actively hunted, in one jurisdiction but not another. [Q:] How many factors contribute to endemism? [A:] Three.  [Q:] Is psychological one of those? [A:] No.  [Q:] What about biological? [A:] Yes.  [Q:] What are the other two? [A:] Physical and climatic  [Q:] In what country is the orange breasted sunbird found? [A:] South Africa  [Q:] Is it found throughout the country? [A:] No  [Q:] Which region of South Africa? [A:] southwestern  [Q:] And what zone? [A:] Fynbos vegetation zone.  [Q:] Does the term endemic have a latin root? [A:] Yes  [Q:] What else? [A:] Greek  [Q:] What would "en" translate to? [A:] "in"  [Q:] And "demos"? [A:] "the people"  [Q:] What term means the same thing? [A:] Precinctive  [Q:] Who first used that? [A:] MacCaughey  [Q:] Was he studying animal species? [A:] No.  [Q:] Can something be indiginous but not endemic? [A:] Yes.  [Q:] What would cause that? [A:] They are also found elsewhere.  [Q:] What is its opposite? [A:] Cosmopolitan distribution  [Q:] What is the definition of endemism? [A:] The ecological state of a species being unique to a defined geographic location  [Q:] Give me one example of a geographic location in this sense. [A:] An island

Jamie and his friends love playing baseball. They play in the park every morning. One summer morning they lost the baseball. Jamie and his friend Joe went to the store. They bought two baseballs. They also bought colas for the other kids. They spent ten dollars. Jamie and Joe went back to the park. His friend Mike drank his cola and went to bat. Mike hit a home run and rounded the bases. All of Jamie's friends cheered very loudly. The sun was very bright and Jamie had an idea. Jamie and his friends went to the pool in town and swam that afternoon.

My summer hols wr CWOT. B4, we usd 2 go 2 NY 2C my bro, his GF & thr3:-@ kids FTF. ILNY, it's gr8. Can you understand this sentence? If you can't, don't feel too bad; neither could the middle school teacher in England who received this as homework. This is Netspeak: the language of computerized communication found on Internet or cell phones. To new comers, it can look like a completely foreign language. So, what is the translation of the sentence above? My summer holidays were a complete waste of time. Before, we used to go to New York to see my brother, his girlfriend, and their three screaming kids face to face. I love New York. It's great. School teachers and parents say this new form of writing is harming the English language. Increasing spelling and grammatical mistakes can be seen in students' writing. They fear the language could become corrupted . "Everyone should just relax", say linguists . They believe Netspeak is in fact more of a good thing. David Crystal, from the University of Wales, argues that Netspeak and Internet create a new language use and the almost lost art of diary writing, has been picked up again. Geoffrey Nurberg, from Stanford University, agrees. "People get better at writing by writing," he says. "kids who are now doing text messaging, e-mails, and instant messages will write at least as well as, and possibly better than their parents." Linguist James says, for centuries, it is believed without exception that young people are harming the language. And you can _ that when today's teenagers become tomorrow's parents. They too will think this way. James argues that languages do not and cannot become corrupted. They simply change to meet the new needs. However, Netspeakers do agree that it is important to teach young people how to speak and write standard English. Cynthia McVey says, "I can understand Netspeak worries teachers and it's important that they get across to their pupils that text messaging is for fun, but learning to write proper English is a must for their future." Perhaps we should give teenagers a little more trust anyway. Erin, aged 12, says, "I wouldn't use text language in my homework. Texting is just for fun. " [Q:] who is David Crystal?

Andy never wanted to go to bed on time. His parents had explained to him how important it was to go to bed early and get a good rest. But Andy paid no attention to them, and they didn't know what to do until one weekend when they were visiting Andy's grandparents. 

Grandpa Peter heard all about it and said, "This sounds like a job for Tubby." So Andy's parents loaded the cat onto the car and returned home. 

That night, at bedtime, the same problem happened. Andy didn't want to go to bed, and even though his parents waited a while to see if Tubby would solve the problem, nothing happened. [:++Z+X+X+K] 

Hours later, Andy finally decided to go to bed. But what a surprise when he entered his bedroom! Tubby was in his bed, totally sprawling out, pot-belly in the air, and _ like an express train. 

Andy tried to move the cat, but there was no way of moving him an inch. That night he hardly slept, lying on one tiny corner of his bed. 

The next day the same thing happened, even though Andy was much more tired from not having slept well. When the third day arrived, he had understood that if he wanted to sleep in his bed, he would have to get into it before Tubby did. That night, when his parents only started to mention the topic of bedtime, Andy rushed upstairs and dived into bed. His parents could not believe it. They knew nothing about Tubby in the bed, nor did they understand why Andy went to bed on time without complaint. They were so happy about this that they stayed up quite late, celebrating.

CHAPTER 33 

From darkness here and dreariness, We ask not full repose. --CHRISTIAN YEAR 

It seemed as if the fatigue which Guy had undergone was going to make itself felt at last, for he had a slight headache the next morning, and seemed dull and weary. Both he and Amabel sat for some time with Philip, and when she went away to write her letters, Philip began discussing a plan which had occurred to him of offering himself as chief of the constabulary force in the county where Redclyffe was situated. It was an office which would suit him very well, and opened a new hope of his marriage, and he proceeded to reckon on Lord Thorndale's interest, counting up all the magistrates he knew, and talking them over with Guy, who, however, did not know enough of his own neighbourhood to be of much use; and when he came up-stairs a little after, said he was vexed at having been so stupid. He was afraid he had seemed unkind and indifferent. But the truth was that he was so heavy and drowsy, that he had actually fallen twice into a doze while Philip was talking. 

'Of course,' said Amy, 'gentle sleep will take her revenge at last for your calling her a popular delusion. Lie down, let her have her own way, and you will be good for something by and by.' 

He took her advice, slept for a couple of hours, and awoke a good deal refreshed, so that though his head still ached, he was able to attend as usual to Philip in the evening.  [Q:] How did the man feel in the morning? [A:] dull and weary with a headache  [Q:] Whi was he with? [A:] Amabel and Philip  [Q:] What were they doing? [A:] sitting  [Q:] Did Anabel stay sitting?

Two years ago ,Hannah Mighall ,then 13, survived a great white shark attack on Tasmania's north-east coast, but despite the terrible scars ,the shy yet courageous teenager is determined to get back into the water. 

It's been a long journey back for the brave girl, whose life was changed forever as she was on her surfboard 60 metres offshore at Binalong, Bay ,Tasmania. 

Her cousin ,32-yeaf-old syb Mundy ,was surfing nearby, "Suddenly, everything went quiet ,"Hannah ,now15,recalls of the day she almost lost her life, "I look down into the water and noticed a dark shadow under my board I knew instantly it was a shark." 

As Syb watched in horror, the five-metre shark put hundreds of sharp teeth onto Hannah's right leg,throwing her from her board, "I was attached to my leg-rope as the shark stared to pull me under the water",She shakes, "I was lying on my back with one leg under the shark's body and the other still in its jaws." 

Syb desperately punched the shark's nose and reached out to grab Hannah as the monster bit a huge chunk from the surfboard, "I was still attached to my board and was dragged back under the water again,"she says ,When she came up for air, Hannah dog paddled to Syb's board and he dragged her from the water to lie on his back ,"We looked down and saw the shark circling beneath us,"Hannah says. 

Hannah was rushed to the hospital by helicopter ,She needed more than 400 stitches on her leg and spent two weeks in hospital. 

Modest about her remarkable courage, Hannah owes her survival to Syb's bravery and the fact that great whites,despite their reputation as man-eaters, typically don't target humans ,After the attack ,Hannah earned the Sea Shepherd award for courage for speaking in defence of the shark "I was in his territory, she wasn't in mine,"she smiles.

The Bronx /ˈbrɒŋks/ is the northernmost of the five boroughs (counties) of New York City in the state of New York, located south of Westchester County. Many bridges and tunnels link the Bronx to the island and borough of Manhattan to the west over and under the narrow Harlem River, as well as three longer bridges south over the East River to the borough of Queens. Of the five boroughs, the Bronx is the only one on the U.S. mainland and, with a land area of 42 square miles (109 km2) and a population of 1,438,159 in 2014, has the fourth largest land area, the fourth highest population, and the third-highest population density. 

The Bronx is named after Jonas Bronck who created the first settlement as part of the New Netherland colony in 1639. The native Lenape were displaced after 1643 by settlers. In the 19th and 20th centuries, the Bronx received many immigrant groups as it was transformed into an urban community, first from various European countries (particularly Ireland, Germany and Italy) and later from the Caribbean region (particularly Puerto Rico, Jamaica and the Dominican Republic), as well as African American migrants from the American South. This cultural mix has made the Bronx a wellspring of both Latin music and hip hop. [Q:] NYC has how many counties? [A:] five  [Q:] which one is the farthest north?

Time was running out, and Mark Dickinson wasn't sure whether he'd get to see his dying 2-year-old grandson one last time. A long line at Los Angeles International Airport's security checkpoint had kept him from getting to his gate on time. 

His grandson Caden would be taken off life support in a matter of hours in Denver, Colorado, with or without his grandfather's presence, according to CNN affiliate KABC. 

"I was kind of panicking because I was running late, and I really thought I wasn't going to make the flight," Dickinson told KABC. 

That's when a pilot from Southwest Airlines stepped up and held the flight at the gate until Dickinson arrived. The pilot was standing by the air bridge waiting for him when Dickinson arrived in socks, so rushed that he just grabbed his shoes at security and ran through the terminal. 

"I told him, 'Thank you so much. I can't tell you how much I appreciated that.' And he said, 'No problem. They can't leave without me anyway,'"Dickinson told KABC. 

Authorities say Dickinson's grandson, Caden Rodgers, suffered a head injury after his mother's boyfriend threw him across the room. The boyfriend reportedly told police he was drunk and high on marijuana at the time. The child later died and the boyfriend has been charged with first-degree murder, according to the Aurora Sentinel. 

Thanks to the pilot, Dickinson made it to Colorado in time to say goodbye to his grandson. Most airlines would punish any staff member who holds up a flight, according to consumer advocate Christopher Elliott, who broke the story of the sympathetic pilot on his blog. However, a Southwest spokeswoman said the pilot's actions were praiseworthy. 

"You can't hold a plane for every late customer, but I think we would all agree that these were extenuating circumstances and the pilot absolutely made the right decision," Southwest spokeswoman Marilee McInnis said. "I don't think you could ask for a better example of great service for our customers." [Q:] Who is Dickinson's grandson? [A:] Caden  [Q:] What type of injury did he suffer?

A little boy named Joey did not like to brush his teeth. One day, as his mother asked him to brush his teeth, Joey said, "I don't want to! It's gross and a waste of time!" In response, Joey's mom told him that in order for him to grow up and be big and strong like she is, he must brush his teeth. In disgust, with his mom watching to make sure he brushed his teeth right, he brushed his teeth and whined until he was finished. The next day, Joey did not brush his teeth and told his mom that he did. After going to school, one of Joey's friends said that his breath stunk and began to make fun of him. This made Joey very angry, so he pushed the boy over and started to cry. A teacher came over and called the principal as both kids were being loud and starting a fight. Joey's mom came to school and took him home. After asking what was wrong, Joey told his mom that he didn't brush his teeth. After hearing this, his mom marched him up to the bathroom and forced him to brush his teeth. "You won't get teased if you brush your teeth, Joey!" she yelled, and then left the room. From that day forward, Joey brushed his teeth every day so the other kids wouldn't make fun of him. [Q:] What was the boys name? [A:] Joey  [Q:] Joey didn't like to what?

Richmond, Virginia (CNN) -- The Virginia governor's race, billed as the marquee battle of an otherwise anticlimactic 2013 election cycle, is shaping up to be a foregone conclusion. 

Democrat Terry McAuliffe, the longtime political fixer and moneyman, hasn't trailed in a poll since May. Barring a political miracle, Republican Ken Cuccinelli will be delivering a concession speech on Tuesday evening in Richmond. 

In recent cycles, the Virginia race has been a key off-year barometer of national political sentiment. Four years ago, Republican Bob McDonnell won in blowout fashion, a victory that presaged the following year's GOP midterm wave. In 2005, Democrat Tim Kaine captured the governor's mansion, tapping into anxiety about President George W. Bush's handling of the Iraq War and Hurricane Katrina. 

Not so this year. The McAuliffe-Cuccinelli race has been defined by small-bore issues and character attacks rather than sweeping national concerns. 

But despite the lack of late fireworks, there are plenty of crucial insights to be gleaned from the Virginia campaign. 

Here's what you need to know about this year's most important race: 

1. The 2012 playbook is still potent for Democrats 

McAuliffe isn't exactly squeaky-clean. A longtime wheeler-dealer who has been less than forthcoming with his tax returns, "the Macker" has a history of eyebrow-raising business ventures that make for dangerous campaign fodder. The opposition research book on the former Democratic National Committee chairman is as thick a Virginia live oak. 

But Democrats have successfully turned the race into a referendum on Cuccinelli, defining him over the summer as a right-wing zealot.

The first police officer at the scene of Tupac Shakur's 1996 drive-by murder has revealed the last words spoken by the late rap legend. And they're not exactly peaceful. 

"He looked at me, and he took a breath to get the words out, and he opened his mouth," says Chris Carroll, a retired sergeant with the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department, in a new feature with Vegas Seven. "And then the words came out: 'F**k you.'"

Shakur was shot multiple times on September 7th, 1996. After leaving a boxing match with former Death Row Records CEO Suge Knight, the rapper and his bodyguards got into a scuffle with 21-year-old Crips gang member Orlando Anderson in the lobby of the MGM Grand casino. Carroll, who worked with the city's bike patrol unit, had also been watching the same Mike Tyson fight, but was unaware of the brawl taking place in the lobby. 

Later, a white Cadillac pulled up beside Knight and Shakur while they were stopped at a traffic light and one man began shooting out of the back window. Carroll was the first officer to respond to the grisly scene. 

"I grab the car door and I'm trying to open it, but I can't get it open," he says. "[Knight] keeps coming up on my back, so I'm pointing my gun at him. I'm pointing it at the car. I'm yelling, 'You guys lay down! And you, get the f**k away from me!' And every time I'd point the gun at him, he'd back off and even lift his hands up, like 'All right! All right!' So I'd go back to the car, and here he comes again. I'm like, 'F**ker, back off!' This guy is huge, and the whole time he's running around at the scene, he's gushing blood from his head. Gushing blood! I mean the guy had clearly been hit in the head, but he had all his faculties. I couldn't believe he was running around and doing what he was doing, yelling back and forth."

CHAPTER VIII 

"I AM WEARY OF A HOPELESS LOVE" 

Paul and Arthur shared a bachelor residence in Mayfair; shared it, that is to say, insomuch as Paul had purchased it, and was the sole proprietor, and Arthur used it whenever he could get leave from his regiment. It was here Paul found his brother on the morning of his arrival in London. 

They shook hands in silence; Paul did not wish to say anything for a moment. His brother's appearance had choked him. It was one o'clock, but he was still in his dressing-gown; with sunken, pale cheeks, save for one bright spot, and with faint, dark rims underneath his eyes. There were a pile of blue papers and some ominous-looking envelopes on the table before him, and Paul could not help noticing the intense pallor of the hand which rested upon them. 

"I wish you would let a fellow know what time you were coming," Arthur said, rather peevishly, but with an attempt at a smile. "I didn't expect you till evening, so I was having a shack before dressing. I was late last night!" 

Paul banished his gravity, as far as possible, and stood with his hands in his pockets, leaning against the mantel-piece. He heartily disliked the part of mentor, and he did not wish to play it, unless he were obliged. 

"It was beastly early to get up," he said, "but the connection at Normanton is so much better. One has to wait two hours by the late train, and Normanton is such a hole. I don't know that I should have come up to town at all, just yet," he continued after a slight pause, "only that I'm on the committee at the club this term, you know, and I haven't attended a single meeting yet. Besides, I promised Westover to put him up this time, and the half-yearly meeting's to-morrow, you know. Got any engagement? If not, you might dine with me there. Always a full night election time, you know!"  [Q:] Where was the joint residence? [A:] in Mayfair  [Q:] who owns it? [A:] Paul  [Q:] who else stayed there? [A:] Arthur  [Q:] how often? [A:] whenever he was on leave  [Q:] from what? [A:] from his regiment.  [Q:] who is his brother? [A:] Paul and Arthur were brothers  [Q:] where did they meet up? [A:] in the bachelor residence  [Q:] when? [A:] in the morning  [Q:] what was their interaction? [A:] they shook hands  [Q:] what did Arthur look like? [A:] very tired
Lisa has a pet cat named Whiskers. Whiskers is black with a white spot on her chest. Whiskers also has white paws that look like little white mittens. 

Whiskers likes to sleep in the sun on her favorite chair. Whiskers also likes to drink creamy milk. 

Lisa is excited because on Saturday, Whiskers turns two years old. 

After school on Friday, Lisa rushes to the pet store. She wants to buy Whiskers' birthday presents. Last year, she gave Whiskers a play mouse and a blue feather. 

For this birthday, Lisa is going to give Whiskers a red ball of yarn and a bowl with a picture of a cat on the side. The picture is of a black cat. It looks a lot like Whiskers.

One of the jurors who acquitted George Zimmerman said she had "no doubt" he feared for his life in the final moments of his struggle with Trayvon Martin, and that was the definitive factor in the verdict. 

The woman, who was identified just as Juror B37, spoke exclusively to CNN's "Anderson Cooper 360" on Monday night. She is the first juror to speak publicly about the case. 

She said she believes Zimmerman's "heart was in the right place" the night he shot Martin, but that he didn't use "good judgment" in confronting the Florida teen. 

"I think George Zimmerman is a man whose heart was in the right place, but just got displaced by the vandalism in the neighborhoods, and wanting to catch these people so badly that he went above and beyond what he really should have done," she said.

"But I think his heart was in the right place. It just went terribly wrong." 

If anything, Zimmerman was guilty of not using "good judgment," the juror said. 

"When he was in the car, and he had called 911, he shouldn't have gotten out of that car," she said. 

She also said she believes Martin threw the first punch in the confrontation that followed. 

"I think George got in a little bit too deep, which he shouldn't have been there. But Trayvon decided that he wasn't going to let him scare him ... and I think Trayvon got mad and attacked him," she said.  [Q:] What does this juror think Zimmerman was guilty of? [A:] not using "good judgment  [Q:] What does she think he should have done? [A:] he shouldn't have gotten out of that car  [Q:] Did he call for help> [A:] yes  [Q:] Where was he when he called? [A:] in the car  [Q:] What does she think of his intentions? [A:] Zimmerman's "heart was in the right place"  [Q:] Who was he trying to catch? [A:] Trayvon Martin  [Q:] Who was messing up the neighborhoods? [A:] vandals  [Q:] How did he feel about that? [A:] wanting to catch these people so badly  [Q:] Did the vandalism upset him? [A:] yes  [Q:] What is this woman called? [A:] Juror B37  [Q:] Who did she talk with? [A:] CNN's "Anderson Cooper 360"  [Q:] Just them? [A:] yes  [Q:] When? [A:] Monday night  [Q:] Did any other jurors come out before her? [A:] no  [Q:] What happened to Martin? [A:] he shot Martin  [Q:] Do you know why? [A:] Trayvon got mad and attacked him  [Q:] Did he get sentenced for this crime? [A:] no  [Q:] Why not? [A:] he feared for his life  [Q:] Did they find him guilty? [A:] no  [Q:] Where did this happen? [A:] unknown
Writing articles about films for The Front Page was my first proper job. Before then I had done bits of reviewing--novels for other newspapers, films for a magazine and anything I was asked to do for the radio. That was how I met Tom Seaton, the first arts editor of The Front Page, who had also written for television. He hired me, but Tom was not primarily a journalist, or he would certainly have been more careful in choosing his staff. 

At first, his idea was that a team of critics should take care of the art forms that didn't require specialized knowledge: books, TV, theatre, film and radio. There would be a weekly lunch at which we would make our choices from the artistic material that Tom had decided we should cover, though there would also be guests to make the atmosphere sociable. 

It all felt like a bit of dream at that time: a new newspaper and I was one of the team. It seemed so unlikely that a paper could be introduced into a crowded market. It seemed just as likely that a millionaire wanted to help me personally, and was pretending to employ me. Such was my lack of self-confidence. 

Tom's original scheme for a team of critics for the arts never took off. It was a good idea, but we didn't get together as planned and so everything was done by phone. It turned out, too, that the general public out there preferred to associate a reviewer with a single subject area, and so I chose film. Without Tom's initial push, though, we would hardly have come up with the present arrangement, by which I write an extended weekly piece, usually on one film. 

The space I am given allows me to broaden my argument--or forces me, in an uninteresting week, to make something out of nothing. But what is my role in the public arena? I assume that people choose what films to go to on the basis of the stars, the publicity or the director. So if a film review isn't really a consumer guide, what is it? I certainly don't feel I have a responsibility to be 'right' about a movie. Nor do I think there should be a certain number of 'great' and 'bad' films each year. All I have to do is put forward an argument. I'm not a judge, and nor would I want to be. [Q:] What was their first job? [A:] Writing articles about films for The Front Page  [Q:] Who did they meet? [A:] editing for the front page  [Q:] Did he hire them? [A:] yes  [Q:] Who hired them? [A:] Tom Seaton  [Q:] Who was he? [A:] the first arts editor of The Front Page  [Q:] What else had he done [A:] he had also written for television.  [Q:] Was he first and foremost a journalist? [A:] no  [Q:] Would there be a weekly lunch? [A:] yes  [Q:] Would there be guests there? [A:] yes  [Q:] Why? [A:] to make the atmosphere sociable.
(Financial Times) -- While most consumer goods companies are seeking opportunities in China, domestic condom maker Safedom is going in the opposite direction -- seeking European partners or acquisitions as part of a bid to go global. 

The company, majority-owned by its founder, has grown rapidly in its short life. It will sell 200m condoms this year, all within China, and is targeting sales of 1bn next year; the same number that Durex, the world's biggest player, was producing in the country within three years. 

Brian Fu, chief executive, was in the UK last week "meeting potential partners and acquisitions". Funding for any deal will either come from existing shareholders, bank loans or possibly through an overseas stock market listing, he said. 

Despite the size of the market on its own doorstep -- and added attraction of a government-mandated one-child policy -- Safedom sees its future on the international stage. It reckons its virus-proof latex condoms will enable it to compete alongside the global players such as Durex, now part of Reckitt Benckiser, and Ansell of Australia. 

However, Mr Fu said that the strength of his company -- whose range includes Beautiful Girl, Take Me and Green Lemon -- was in manufacturing and technology, and going global required bringing in branding and marketing expertise. 

Sales outlets and channels are also likely to vary from China, where half of all condoms are bought by women. 

"We think we have good leading edge technology and a good management team. What we lack is the branding part: we are not well known," Mr Fu said.  [Q:] What company makes condoms? [A:] Safedom  [Q:] What is it seeking? [A:] European partners or acquisitions as part of a bid to go global  [Q:] Who owns the majority of the company?

CHAPTER XXVII 

WHAT ELSA SAW IN THE MOONLIGHT 

It will be remembered that some weeks before Elsa's forced marriage in the Red Mill, Foy, on their escape from the Gevangenhuis, had been carried upon the naked back of Martin to the shelter of Mother Martha's lair in the Haarlemer Meer. Here he lay sick many days, for the sword cut in his thigh festered so badly that at one time his life was threatened by gangrene, but, in the end, his own strength and healthy constitution, helped with Martha's simples, cured him. So soon as he was strong again, accompanied by Martin, he travelled into Leyden, which now it was safe enough for him to visit, since the Spaniards were driven from the town. 

How his young heart swelled as, still limping a little and somewhat pale from recent illness, he approached the well-known house in the Bree Straat, the home that sheltered his mother and his love. Presently he would see them again, for the news had been brought to him that Lysbeth was out of danger and Elsa must still be nursing her. 

Lysbeth he found indeed, turned into an old woman by grief and sore sickness, but Elsa he did not find. She had vanished. On the previous night she had gone out to take the air, and returned no more. What had become of her none could say. All the town talked of it, and his mother was half-crazed with anxiety and fear, fear of the worst.  [Q:] who was carried? [A:] Foy  [Q:] on what? [A:] the naked back of Martin  [Q:] where to? [A:] the shelter of Mother Martha's lair  [Q:] what event was this prior to? [A:] Elsa's forced marriage  [Q:] where?

A One Day International (ODI) is a form of limited overs cricket, played between two teams with international status, in which each team faces a fixed number of overs, usually 50. The Cricket World Cup is played in this format. One Day International matches are also called Limited Overs Internationals (LOI), although this generic term may also refer to Twenty20 International matches. They are major matches and considered the highest standard of List A, limited overs competition. 

The international one-day game is a late twentieth-century development. The first ODI was played on 5 January 1971 between Australia and England at the Melbourne Cricket Ground. When the first three days of the third Test were washed out officials decided to abandon the match and, instead, play a one-off one day game consisting of 40 eight-ball overs per side. Australia won the game by 5 wickets. ODIs were played in white kits with a red ball. 

In the late 1970s, Kerry Packer established the rival World Series Cricket competition, and it introduced many of the features of One Day International cricket that are now commonplace, including coloured uniforms, matches played at night under floodlights with a white ball and dark sight screens, and, for television broadcasts, multiple camera angles, effects microphones to capture sounds from the players on the pitch, and on-screen graphics. The first of the matches with coloured uniforms was the WSC Australians in wattle gold versus WSC West Indians in coral pink, played at VFL Park in Melbourne on 17 January 1979. This led not only to Kerry Packer's Channel 9 getting the TV rights to cricket in Australia but also led to players worldwide being paid to play, and becoming international professionals, no longer needing jobs outside cricket. Matches played with coloured kits and a white ball became more commonplace over time, and the use of white flannels and a red ball in ODIs was finally abandoned in 2001. [Q:] How long is an ODI?

CHAPTER XVI. THE SUPREME SACRIFICE 

THROUGH the balance of the day and all during the long night Billy Byrne swung along his lonely way, retracing the familiar steps of the journey that had brought Barbara Harding and himself to the little island in the turbulent river. 

Just before dawn he came to the edge of the clearing behind the dwelling of the late Oda Yorimoto. Somewhere within the silent village he was sure that the two prisoners lay. 

During the long march he had thrashed over again and again all that the success of his rash venture would mean to him. Of all those who might conceivably stand between him and the woman he loved--the woman who had just acknowledged that she loved him--these two men were the most to be feared. 

Billy Byrne did not for a moment believe that Anthony Harding would look with favor upon the Grand Avenue mucker as a prospective son-in-law. And then there was Mallory! He was sure that Barbara had loved this man, and now should he be restored to her as from the grave there seemed little doubt but that the old love would be aroused in the girl's breast. The truth of the matter was that Billy Byrne could not conceive the truth of the testimony of his own ears--even now he scarce dared believe that the wonderful Miss Harding loved him--him, the despised mucker! 

But the depth of the man's love for the girl, and the genuineness of his new-found character were proven beyond question by the relentless severity with which he put away every thought of himself and the consequences to him in the matter he had undertaken.  [Q:] how long did the main character travel? [A:] THROUGH the balance of the day and all during the long night  [Q:] what is the main character's first name? [A:] Billy  [Q:] what is his last name?

He was a wight of high renown, And thou art but of low degree; 'Tis pride that pulls the country down-- Then take thine auld cloak about thee. SHAKESPEARE. 

The canoe did not reach the mouth of the river until near evening of the third day of its navigation. It was not so much the distance, though that was considerable, as it was the obstacles that lay in the way, which brought the travellers to the end of their journey at so late a period. As they drew nearer and nearer to the place where Gershom had left his wife and sister, le Bourdon detected in his companion signs of an interest in the welfare of the two last, as well as a certain feverish uneasiness lest all might not be well with them, that said something in favor of his heart, whatever might be urged against his prudence and care in leaving them alone in so exposed a situation. 

"I'm afeard a body don't think as much as he ought to do, when liquor is in him," said Whiskey Centre, just as the canoe doubled the last point, and the hut came into view; "else I never could have left two women by them-selves in so lonesome a place. God be praised! there is the chiente at any rate; and there's a smoke comin' out of it, if my eyes don't deceive me! Look, Bourdon, for I can scarcely see at all."

Bob was happy. He was at a new school, and the other students were friendly. "Hi, Bob!" They said. But some students said, "Hi, Peter!" Bob didn't understand. He asked another student, " Why do some students call me Peter?" "Oh, that is easy to answer," the student said. "Peter was a student here last year. Now, he goes to a different school. You like Peter. Some students think that you are Peter." Bob wanted to meet Peter. He got Peter's address from a student and went to Peter's house. Peter opened the door. Bob couldn't believe his eyes. He looked really like Peter! Bob and Peter had the same color eyes and the same smile. They had the same black hair. They also had the same birthday. Bob and Peter found out that they were twin brothers. They both were adopted by two different families. Soon after the boys born, one family adopted Bob, and another family adopted Peter. Bob's family never knew about Peter, and Peter's family never knew about Bob, either. [Q:] Who was happy? [A:] Bob  [Q:] Why? [A:] He was at a new school, and the other students were friendly  [Q:] What was he called? [A:] Peter  [Q:] Where did he go? [A:] to a different school  [Q:] What did Bob do?

The Six-Day War (Hebrew: , "Milhemet Sheshet Ha Yamim"; Arabic: , "an-Naksah", "The Setback" or , "Ḥarb 1967", "War of 1967"), also known as the June War, 1967 Arab–Israeli War, or Third Arab–Israeli War, was fought between June 5 and 10, 1967 by Israel and the neighboring states of Egypt (known at the time as the United Arab Republic), Jordan, and Syria. 

Relations between Israel and its neighbours had never fully normalised following the 1948 Arab–Israeli War. In 1956 Israel invaded the Egyptian Sinai, with one of its objectives being the reopening of the Straits of Tiran which Egypt had blocked to Israeli shipping since 1950. Israel was subsequently forced to withdraw, but won a guarantee that the Straits of Tiran would remain open. Whilst the United Nations Emergency Force was deployed along the border, there was no demilitarisation agreement. 

In the period leading up to June 1967, tensions became dangerously heightened. Israel reiterated its post-1956 position that the closure of the straits of Tiran to its shipping would be a "casus belli" and in late May Nasser announced the straits would be closed to Israeli vessels. Egypt then mobilised its forces along its border with Israel, and on 5 June Israel launched what it claimed were a series of preemptive airstrikes against Egyptian airfields. Claims and counterclaims relating to this series of events are one of a number of controversies relating to the conflict. [Q:] When was the Six-Day War fought?

Ron Meyer is the president and COO of Universal Studios.As one of the most successful business leaders in Hollywood, he heads up Universal Pictures and Universal Parks & Resorts.He's the guy who oversees the production of Multimillion-dollar extravaganzas likeKing KongandCinderella Man. 

Meyer's story sounds like the plot of one of his motion pictures.He grew up in a modest home where there was little income.It was a big deal to go to a restaurant.At 15, he quit high school and spent his time hanging out with the neighborhood toughs .He was then a kid quick with his fists who seemed to get into fights somewhat regularly.At one point, he was separated from others with an infectious disease, having no TV and nothing to do.His mother sent him two books.One wasThe Amboy Dukes, a novel about kids in street gangs.The other wasThe Flesh Peddlers, about a guy in the talent agency who lived a successful life."I realized," he says, "that I was no longer that silly kid I had been, and I wanted to change my life." 

Meyer took any job he could get.He worked as a busboy and short-order cook.He cleaned offices and sold shoes.That attitude made an impression on people.One day he received a call from Paul Kohner, a successful agent who represented stars like John Huston, Charles Bronson and Lana Turner.Their messenger and driver had quit, and they knew Ron was willing to take whatever job they offered. He started the job the next day. 

Meyer was lucky to work with a good boss--and _ .In nearly six years of driving for Kohner, Meyer became his right-hand man and learned a lot.By the 1970s, Meyer had built many relationships in the business.In 1975, the fate presented an opportunity and he started his own operation Creative Artists Agency, which became a huge success, representing Hollywood legends like Barbra Streisand, Tom Hanks and Tom Cruise. 

Twenty years later, Meyer was appointed to run Universal Studios, a position far beyond his youthful dream.But once he saw success was possible, he was driven to achieve it.Today, colleagues regularly owe his success--and theirs--to his humility and perseverance.It's a level of success that takes determination, personality and intelligence, whether it comes from a college education or from the street.

CHAPTER VIII 

A SCENE IN THE GYMNASIUM 

Lew Flapp spoke in such a loud, overbearing voice that a crowd began to collect in the corner where the punching apparatus was located. 

"What's up?" asked more than one cadet. 

"Lew Flapp and Dick Rover are going to try to beat each other at punching the bag," was the report. 

"Rover will have to do his best then. Flapp is a prime one at bag punching. It's about the only thing he can do real well." 

"This isn't a fair contest," put in another student. "Flapp took lessons from a man who used to do bag-punching on the vaudeville stage." 

"If that's so I wouldn't try to beat him, if I was Dick Rover." 

Dick heard some of this talk but said nothing. He was soon ready for the trial, and stepping up to the punching bag he began to undo the top strap. 

"That bag is all right," blustered Lew Flapp. 

"Yes--for you," answered Dick. "But you must remember, I am not quite so tall. I must have it an inch lower." 

"It seems to me you are mighty particular." 

"I have a right to be. When you do your punching you can raise the bag as high as you please." 

"That's the talk," came from several standing near. 

By this time Larry was on the floor again, and he came up to learn what Dick was doing. 

"Dick, they tell me he is the best bag-puncher here," whispered Larry. 

"I can't help it."  [Q:] What is the title? [A:] A SCENE IN THE GYMNASIUM  [Q:] Who was being overly vocal? [A:] Lew Flapp  [Q:] What did it cause to form [A:] a crowd  [Q:] What was about to happen?

Ordination is the process by which individuals are consecrated, that is, set apart as clergy to perform various religious rites and ceremonies. The process and ceremonies of ordination vary by religion and denomination. One who is in preparation for, or who is undergoing the process of ordination is sometimes called an ordinand. The liturgy used at an ordination is sometimes referred to as an ordination. 

The tradition of the ordained monastic community ("sangha") began with the Buddha, who established orders of monks and later of nuns. The procedure of ordination in Buddhism is laid down in the Vinaya and Patimokkha or Pratimoksha scriptures. There exist three intact ordination lineages nowadays in which one can receive an ordination according to the Buddha's teachings: 

Saicho repeatedly requested that the Japanese government allow the construction of a Mahayana ordination platform. Permission was granted in 822 CE, seven days after Saicho died. The platform was finished in 827 CE at Enryaku-ji temple on Mount Hiei, and was the first in Japan. Prior to this, those wishing to become monks/nuns were ordained using the Hinayana precepts, whereas after the Mahayana ordination platform, people were ordained with the Bodhisattva precepts as listed in the Brahma Net Sutra.

Weimar Republic was an unofficial, historical designation for the German state between 1919 and 1933. The name derives from the city of Weimar, where its constitutional assembly first took place. The official name of the state was "Deutsches Reich"; it had remained unchanged since 1871. In English the country was usually known simply as Germany. A national assembly was convened in Weimar, where a new constitution for the "Deutsches Reich" was written, and adopted on 11 August 1919. In its fourteen years, the Weimar Republic faced numerous problems, including hyperinflation, political extremism (with paramilitaries – both left- and right-wing), as well as contentious relationships with the victors of the First World War. The people of Germany blamed the Weimar Republic rather than their wartime leaders for the country's defeat and for the humiliating terms of the Treaty of Versailles. Weimar Germany fulfilled most of the requirements of the Treaty of Versailles although it never completely met its disarmament requirements, and eventually paid only a small portion of the war reparations (by twice restructuring its debt through the Dawes Plan and the Young Plan). Under the Locarno Treaties, Germany accepted the western borders of the republic, but continued to dispute the Eastern border.

CHAPTER 6 

Can piety the discord heal, Or stanch the death-feud's enmity? --Scott 

It must not be supposed that such a history of Guy's mind was expressed by himself, or understood by Mrs. Edmonstone; but she saw enough to guess at his character, perceive the sort of guidance he needed, and be doubly interested in him. Much did she wish he could have such a friend as her brother would have been, and hope that nothing would prevent a friendship with her nephew. 

The present question about the horse was, she thought, unfortunate, since, though Guy had exercised great self-denial, it was no wonder Philip was annoyed. Mr. Edmonstone's vexation was soon over. As soon as she had persuaded him that there had been no offence, he strove to say with a good grace, that it was very proper, and told Guy he would be a thorough book-worm and tremendous scholar, which Guy took as an excellent joke. 

Philip had made up his mind to be forbearing, and to say no more about it. Laura thought this a pity, as they could thus never come to an understanding; but when she hinted it, he wore such a dignified air of not being offended, that she was much ashamed of having tried to direct one so much better able to judge. On his side Guy had no idea the trouble he had caused; so, after bestowing his thanks in a gay, off-hand way, which Philip thought the worst feature of the case, he did his best to bring Hecuba back into his mind, drive the hunters out of it, and appease the much-aggrieved William of Deloraine.  [Q:] Who wanted a friend like her brother? [A:] Mrs. Edmonstone  [Q:] Who was annoyed? [A:] Philip  [Q:] Was Guy annoyed about the idea of being a bookworm? [A:] No  [Q:] What did he think of it? [A:] Hecuba  [Q:] Did Philip decide to keep talking about the issue? [A:] No  [Q:] What did he decide? [A:] to be forbearing  [Q:] Who thought they could never come to an agreement? [A:] Laura  [Q:] What gave thanks in a careless manner? [A:] Guy  [Q:] Who was from Deloraine? [A:] William  [Q:] Did Guy understand the trouble he made? [A:] No
The Arena Football League (AFL) is the highest level of professional indoor American football in the United States. It was founded in 1987 by Jim Foster, making it the third longest-running professional football league in North America, after the Canadian Football League and the National Football League. It is played indoors on a 68-yard field (about half the distance of an NFL field), resulting in a faster-paced and higher-scoring game. The sport was invented in the early 1980s and patented by Foster, a former executive of the United States Football League and the National Football League. 

For its 2015 season, the league consisted of 12 teams, all from the United States; however, upon the completion of the regular season, the league announced that the two teams it had assumed operation of during the season would cease all operations effective immediately; a regular season game slated between the two had previously been canceled and declared a tie. Subsequently, one of the remaining teams, the Spokane Shock, severed its ties with the league to join the competing IFL. The AFL is divided into two conferences – the American Conference and National Conference. Starting 2016, each conference will have only four teams as the champion San Jose SaberCats announced in November 2015 that they were ceasing activity for "reasons not associated with League operations."

Germany, officially the Federal Republic of Germany, is a federal parliamentary republic in central-western Europe. It includes 16 constituent states, covers an area of , and has a largely temperate seasonal climate. With about 82 million inhabitants, Germany is the most populous member state of the European Union. After the United States, it is the second most popular immigration destination in the world. Germany's capital and largest metropolis is Berlin, while its largest conurbation is the Ruhr, with its main centres of Dortmund and Essen. The country's other major cities are Hamburg, Munich, Cologne, Frankfurt, Stuttgart, Düsseldorf, Leipzig, Bremen, Dresden, Hannover and Nuremberg. 

Various Germanic tribes have inhabited the northern parts of modern Germany since classical antiquity. A region named Germania was documented before 100 AD. During the Migration Period, the Germanic tribes expanded southward. Beginning in the 10th century, German territories formed a central part of the Holy Roman Empire. During the 16th century, northern German regions became the centre of the Protestant Reformation. After the collapse of the Holy Roman Empire, the German Confederation was formed in 1815. The German revolutions of 1848–49 resulted in the Frankfurt Parliament establishing major democratic rights. 

In 1871, Germany became a nation state when most of the German states unified into the Prussian-dominated German Empire. After World War I and the German Revolution of 1918–19, the Empire was replaced by the parliamentary Weimar Republic. In 1933 the Nazi seizure of power quickly led to the establishment of Nazi Germany which was built upon a dictatorship and consequently led to World War II and the Holocaust. After the end of World War II in Europe and a period of Allied occupation, two German states were founded: the democratic West Germany and the socialist East Germany. Following the Revolutions of 1989 that ended communist rule in Central and Eastern Europe, the country was reunified on 3 October 1990. [Q:] When did Germany become a nation state? [A:] In 1871  [Q:] What years were the German Revolution? [A:] 1918–19.  [Q:] After that event, What was the Empire replaced by? [A:] Weimar Republic.  [Q:] When did the Nazi seizure of power happen? [A:] In 1933  [Q:] Did this lead to the establishment of Nazi Germany? [A:] Yes  [Q:] What was that built upon? [A:] A dictatorship  [Q:] How many events did that cause? [A:] Two.  [Q:] What was the first one? [A:] World War II  [Q:] And the second? [A:] The Holocaust.  [Q:] How many states were established after World War II? [A:] Two  [Q:] What were they?

Spain and its autonomous communities are divided into fifty provinces (, ; sing. "provincia"). Ceuta, Melilla and the Plazas de soberanía are not part of any provinces. 

The layout of Spain's provinces closely follows the pattern of the territorial division of the country carried out in 1833. The only major change of provincial borders since that time has been the sub-division of the Canary Islands into two provinces rather than one. 

Historically, the provinces served mainly as transmission belts for policies enacted in Madrid, as Spain was a highly centralised state for most of its history. The importance of the provinces has declined since the adoption of the system of autonomous communities in the period of the Spanish transition to democracy. They nevertheless remain electoral districts for national elections and as geographical references: for instance in postal addresses and telephone codes. 

A small town would normally be identified as being in, say, Valladolid province rather than the autonomous community of Castile and León. The provinces were the "building-blocks" from which the autonomous communities were created. Consequently, no province is divided between more than one of these communities. 

Most of the provinces—with the exception of Álava/Araba, Asturias/Asturies, Bizkaia/Vizcaya, Cantabria, Gipuzkoa/Gipúzcoa, Illes Balears/Islas Baleares, La Rioja, and Nafarroa/Navarra—are named after their principal town. Only two capitals of autonomous communities—Mérida in Extremadura and Santiago de Compostela in Galicia—are not also the capitals of provinces. [Q:] What were provinces historically for? [A:] transmission belts for policies enacted  [Q:] Where are they enacted? [A:] in Madrid  [Q:] What location is divided into fifty provinces? [A:] Spain  [Q:] and?

Since the Protestant Reformation, the most prominent Christian denomination in Thuringia has been Lutheranism. During the GDR period, church membership was discouraged and has continued shrinking since the reunification in 1990. Today over two thirds of the population is non-religious. The Protestant Evangelical Church in Germany has had the largest number of members in the state, adhered to by 24.0% of the population in 2009. Members of the Catholic Church formed 7.8% of the population, while 68.2% of Thuringians were non-religious or adhere to other faiths. The highest Protestant concentrations are in the small villages of southern and western Thuringia, whereas the bigger cities are even more non-religious (up to 88% in Gera). Catholic regions are the Eichsfeld in the northwest and parts of the Rhön Mountains around Geisa in the southwest. Protestant church membership is shrinking rapidly, whereas the Catholic Church is somewhat more stable because of Catholic migration from Poland, Southern Europe and West Germany. Other religions play no significant role in Thuringia. There are only a few thousand Muslims (largely migrants) and about 750 Jews (mostly migrants from Russia) living in Thuringia. Furthermore, there are some Orthodox communities of Eastern European migrants and some traditional Protestant Free churches in Thuringia without any societal influence. [Q:] what is the biggest church in Germany? [A:] The Protestant Evangelical Church  [Q:] what percent of the local people are in that church?

If you were a pilot flying a plane, and suddenly the engine failed, would you eject , or stay in? For a pilot, the choice is very difficult. If he ejects, he is wise, but the plane crashes. If he stays in the plane, he risks his life. 

Recently, Chinese Air Force pilot Li Feng, 38, faced this choice during a training exercise. It was March 7 and he was flying a Jian-10 (Flghter-10) at 4,500 meters. A warning appeared on the plane's computer screen. He realized the plane might fail at any moment. 

Li Feng did a quick check of the engine and asked the base if he could return. When the fighter was 7km away from the airport, however, the engine stopped working. The plane began to fall at a speed of 25 meters a second from an altitude of 1,160 meters. 

Under Air Force rules fighter pilots may eject if their aircraft loses engine power below 2,000 meters and can't be restarted. Before Li lost contact with the control tower, the commander in the air base asked him to eject. But Li Feng insisted on having another try. 

"I knew where the deadline (to abandon the aircraft) was and was prepared for the ejection, but I decided not to give up unless the fighter was totally out of control," Li recalled during a recent television interview. 

After 104 seconds, Li was able to bring the fighter to a safe landing. The plane only suffered slight damage. 

"You are a hero! Congratulations!" Li's teacher, Xu yongling wrote in a text message to him after the landing. He said Li was a cool-headed pilot and very professional. 

Li's brave and calm act not only saved the 200 million yuan aircraft but also gave him invaluable first-hand experience of dealing with an engine emergency. 

For his outstanding performance, the Air Force recently awarded him a gold medal. [Q:] who was flying the plane? [A:] Li Feng  [Q:] from what country? [A:] China  [Q:] his age?

Jupiter is the fifth planet from the Sun and the largest in the Solar System. It is a giant planet with a mass one-thousandth that of the Sun, but two and a half times that of all the other planets in the Solar System combined. Jupiter and Saturn are gas giants; the other two giant planets, Uranus and Neptune are ice giants. Jupiter has been known to astronomers since antiquity. The Romans named it after their god Jupiter. When viewed from Earth, Jupiter can reach an apparent magnitude of −2.94, bright enough for its reflected light to cast shadows, and making it on average the third-brightest object in the night sky after the Moon and Venus. 

Jupiter is primarily composed of hydrogen with a quarter of its mass being helium, though helium comprises only about a tenth of the number of molecules. It may also have a rocky core of heavier elements, but like the other giant planets, Jupiter lacks a well-defined solid surface. Because of its rapid rotation, the planet's shape is that of an oblate spheroid (it has a slight but noticeable bulge around the equator). The outer atmosphere is visibly segregated into several bands at different latitudes, resulting in turbulence and storms along their interacting boundaries. A prominent result is the Great Red Spot, a giant storm that is known to have existed since at least the 17th century when it was first seen by telescope. Surrounding Jupiter is a faint planetary ring system and a powerful magnetosphere. Jupiter has at least 69 moons, including the four large Galilean moons discovered by Galileo Galilei in 1610. Ganymede, the largest of these, has a diameter greater than that of the planet Mercury. [Q:] What is the largest planet in the solar system? [A:] Jupiter  [Q:] What is it mostly made of?

The Canada 2006 Census was a detailed enumeration of the Canadian population. Census day was May 16, 2006. The following census was the 2011 Census. Canada's total population enumerated by the 2006 census was 31,612,897. This count was lower than the official July 1, 2006 population estimate of 32,623,490 people. 

Over 12.7 million households, 32.5 million people were expected to be counted. Canada Post delivered census forms by mail to 70% of the country, primarily residents in urban areas. Census enumerators delivered to the remaining 30% of households. Every fifth home received the long questionnaire (53 questions versus 8 questions on the short form). For the first time, Canadian residents were able to go online to fill in their forms. Statistics Canada expected approximately 20% of households to file their surveys electronically. Persistent census staff are contacting tardy households. The total estimated cost of the 2006 census is $567 million spread over seven years, employing more than 25,000 full and part-time census workers.

Sometimes Karen likes to go to the library. Her friend Michael also likes the library, but her other friend James does not like the library. Karen and Michael like to read about different things. They can learn about things that they don't know much about. They also like to read fun and exciting stories. 

The librarian, Mr. Hernandez, knows Michael and Karen, because they are in the library a lot. He knows what kind of books they like. When the library gets new books, he tells Karen and Michael about any books that he thinks they would like. James only goes to the library when he has to read a book for class. Mr. Hernandez does not know very much about James, because James does not go to the library often. 

Karen's favorite books are about airplanes, cars, and trains. She like reading about how fast they can go, and about the workers who build them. When she grows up, she is going to buy a fast car and travel to different states. Michael likes books about dinosaurs, cowboys, and fireworks.

CHAPTER XIII. 

THE LETTER. 

There could be no question but that Ninety-four's company were highly delighted with the news brought by Seth regarding his progress. 

It was as if each man felt personally complimented by Mr. Fernald when he advanced the amateur so rapidly, and all united in declaring that "Josh was a right good fellow." 

Seth was in the highest degree excited. He had expected that his friends of Ninety-four would be pleased at learning of his good fortune, but never fancied they could be so deeply interested, and now he began to understand what a gloom might be cast over the company if he should fail in this attempt to gain a foothold in the Department. 

'Lish Davis would not be content until the boy gave an exhibition of what he had learned in the way of gymnastic exercises during the morning, and when this had been brought to a close amid the applause of all present, the driver said in a tone of satisfaction: 

"You're getting on in great shape, Amateur, and if nothing happens to give you a pull-back, ought'er be well up in the drill 'twixt now and a year from to-day. Josh Fernald has the name of being precious hard on them as comes under him for instruction; but I've always allowed he'd boost along mighty fast any one who struck his fancy. He must have seen that you were in earnest, young fellow, for when I talked with him the best promise I could get was that he'd look you over in the course of a month or two."

(CNN) -- Major League Baseball on Monday suspended 13 players, including New York Yankees star Alex Rodriguez, after an investigation into the use of performance-enhancing drugs. 

The league suspended Rodriguez for 211 regular-season games through the 2014 season, but the 38-year-old slugger said he planned to appeal. Twelve other players have accepted 50-game suspensions without pay. 

A-Rod and the other players are accused of having ties to the now-shuttered Biogenesis anti-aging clinic in south Florida and taking performance-enhancing drugs. Rodriguez has denied the accusation. 

"I'm fighting for my life. I have to defend myself. If I don't defend myself, no one else will," he told reporters after the league announced its decision. 

Twitter reaction to A-Rod ban 

The last seven months have been a "nightmare," he said. 

It "has been probably the worst time of my life for sure," said Rodriguez, "obviously for the circumstances that are at hand and also dealing with a very tough surgery and a rehab program, and being 38." 

Asked directly whether he had used performance-enhancing drugs, he declined -- repeatedly -- to comment. 

"I think we'll have a forum to discuss all of that, and we'll talk about it then," Rodriguez said. 

Earlier in a written statement, he said that he was disappointed with the penalty and intends to appeal. He thanked family, friends and fans for their support and stressed that he was eager to get back on the field with his teammates.

"If I rest, I _ "----would be an excellent motto for those who are troubled by the slightest bit of idleness.Even the most hard-working person might adopt it with advantage to serve as a reminder that, if one allows his abilities to rest, like the iron in the unused key, they will soon show signs of rust and, eventually, cannot do the work required of them. 

Those who would attain the heights reached and kept by great men must- keep their ability polished by constant use, so that they may unlock the doors of knowledge, the gate that guard the entrances to the professions, to science, art, literature, agriculture--every department of human endeavor. 

Industry keeps the key bright that opens the treasury of achievement.If Hugh Miller, after toiling all day in a quarry, had devoted his evenings to rest and recreation, he would never have become a famous geologist.The celebrated mathematician, Edmund Stone, would never have published a mathematical dictionary, never have found the key to science of mathematics, if he had given his spare moments to idleness, had the little Scotch lad, Ferguson, allowed the busy brain to go to sleep while he tended sheep on the hillside instead of calculating the position of the stars by a string of beads, he would never have become a famous astronomer.

On a snowy winter morning, the brown-haired lady saw a squirrel that was hurt. It only had three legs, and it looked hungry. She put some corn out for the squirrel to eat, but other bully squirrels came, too. The brown-haired lady started giving the little squirrel peanuts to eat. She gave some to the bully squirrels, too, so they would leave the three-legged squirrel alone. 

The winter snow melted and then it was spring. The grass turned green and the air was warm. Now, when the little squirrel with three legs would come to see the brown-haired lady with the peanuts, it would take the peanuts and dig a little hole and hide the peanuts for later. The squirrel would hold the peanut in its mouth and dig and dig and dig, and then it would put the peanut in the hole and pat it down with its little front paw. Then it would run back over to the brown-haired lady and get some more peanuts to eat. [Q:] Who seen a squirrel? [A:] the lady  [Q:] Was it snowing? [A:] yes  [Q:] Did the squirrel have legs?

Bill and Sarah chose to meet at the park on Saturday to play ball and have a picnic. They went to the same grade school together and lived on the same street down from the park. Sarah does not often like boys, but for a boy, Bill was alright. Most boys like Tom and Mark are stupid and a real pain, but Bill was a lot of fun to play with and didn't do dumb things like putting a booger on her back during recess. When Bill and Sarah arrived at the park, they first played ball in the grass near the playground. Then they chose to pretend that Bill was a monster and Sarah was the monster hunter. Sarah chased Bill all over the playground. They went in and out and up and down. Bill ran under the slide and stepped in a puddle. He didn't get hurt but he sure got plenty wet. Playing the monster game was the most fun that they had at the park that day. Later they sat in the grass for a picnic. They both took off their shoes so that Bill's feet could dry off and so that he wouldn't feel silly without shoes. Sarah took out her lunch and laid it out next to her. She had dried fruit and cheese and a peanut butter sandwich. Bill opened his lunch bag and found a coke, a bag of chips, and a ham salad sandwich. Sarah wanted to trade Bill his bag of chips for her fruit. He said that would be a fair trade and they enjoyed their lunch together. After they had their lunch, they lay back in the grass and watched the clouds. Some clouds looked like animals or shapes. Bill spotted one that looked like a reindeer. Sarah pointed to one that looked like a drum. Finally Bill and Sarah got up and brushed off the grass and headed for home. [Q:] Where did Bill and Sarah meet? [A:] the park  [Q:] On what day?

London, England (CNN) -- TV talent show star Susan Boyle will sing for Pope Benedict XVI during his visit to Scotland next month, the Catholic Church in Scotland said Wednesday. 

A church spokesman said in June they were negotiating with the singing phenomenon to perform. 

Benedict is due to visit England and Scotland from September 16-19. 

Boyle will perform three times at Bellahouston Park in Glasgow on Thursday, Sept. 16, the Scottish Catholic Media Office said. She will also sing with the 800-strong choir at the open-air Mass there. 

In the pre-Mass program, Boyle plans to sing the hymn "How Great Thou Art" as well as her signature song, "I Dreamed a Dream," the tune from the musical "Les Miserables" that shot her to fame in April 2009. 

"To be able to sing for the pope is a great honor and something I've always dreamed of -- it's indescribable," Boyle, a Catholic, said in a statement. "I think the 16th of September will stand out in my memory as something I've always wanted to do. I've always wanted to sing for His Holiness and I can't really put into words my happiness that this wish has come true at last." 

Boyle said her late mother was at the same Glasgow park when Pope John Paul II visited in 1982. 

After the final hymn at the end of the Mass, Boyle will sing a farewell song to the pope as he leaves to go to the airport for his flight to London, the church said.  [Q:] who is Susan Boyle ?

CHAPTER XXVI 

THE JUDGMENT OF DOMITIAN 

Two hours had gone by and Caleb, with fury in his heart, sat brooding in the office attached to the warehouse that he had hired. At that moment he had but one desire--to kill his successful rival, Marcus. Marcus had escaped and returned to Rome; of that there could be no doubt. He, one of the wealthiest of its patricians, had furnished the vast sum which enabled old Nehushta to buy the coveted Pearl-Maiden in the slave-ring. Then his newly acquired property had been taken to this house, where he awaited her. This then was the end of their long rivalry; for this he, Caleb, had fought, toiled, schemed and suffered. Oh! rather than such a thing should be, in that dark hour of his soul, he would have seen her cast to the foul Domitian, for Domitian, at least, she would have hated, whereas Marcus, he knew, she loved. 

Now there remained nothing but revenge. Revenged he must be, but how? He might dog Marcus and murder him, only then his own life would be hazarded, since he knew well the fate that awaited the foreigner, and most of all the Jew, who dared to lift his hand against a Roman noble, and if he hired others to do the work they might bear evidence against him. Now Caleb did not wish to die; life seemed the only good that he had left. Also, while he lived he might still win Miriam--after his rival had ceased to live. Doubtless, then she would be sold with his other slaves, and he could buy her at the rate such tarnished goods command. No, he would do nothing to run himself into danger. He would wait, wait and watch his opportunity.  [Q:] What was now left? [A:] revenge  [Q:] Against who? [A:] Marcus  [Q:] What was in the angered man's heart? [A:] fury  [Q:] What was one option to get back at the man? [A:] dog and murder him  [Q:] What was a drawback to that plan? [A:] his own life would be hazarded  [Q:] What was the subject of their rivalry? [A:] the coveted Pearl-Maiden  [Q:] Where had Marcus gotten away from? [A:] unknown  [Q:] What was the maiden's occupation? [A:] a slave  [Q:] And her name? [A:] Miriam  [Q:] What might he be able to do if his rival were dead? [A:] win Miriam
My trip with my sister and my daughter to Manhattan wedding gown(,) shop, cannot be understood without further focusing on Marina, my 14-year-old daughter Ive asked to try on dresses. 

This was the girl I took to Kleinfeld, the fancy store featured on the television program Say Yes to the Dress. As the trip approached, I asked Marina if she was excited. Sure, Mom. shed say, shrugging. Marina was more excited about getting a tattoo on her ankle to represent my fight with ALS than trying on $ 10,000 wedding gowns. 

My sister, Stephanie, had arranged for a car with a wheelchair lift to drive us from the hotel to Kleinfeld. The car driver wheeled me in. 

At Kleinfeld with flower arrangements ten feet high, I felt like rolling into a dream. "Wow!" I said. I was wearing a new black outfit. Marina wore jean shorts, a sleeveless shirt, and sneakers. _ . The kind Kleinfeld ladies pointed out rooms like tour guides, naming the designers one by one on display: Alita Grham, Pnina Tornai... With Marina walking beside me, Stephanie pushed my chair up and down rows and rows of dresses that made Princess Diana's dress look modest. 

Marina didn't say a word. We turned a corner into the storage room, where hundreds of dresses hung in plastic protector sleeves. Marina and I were overwhelmed. 

"Want to try one on ?" I said, touching Marina's hand. 

"OK," Marina said in her sharp, unsure voice. 

"Tell them the style you'd like." 

Marina stood silent. I felt bad for bringing her, for forcing such an adult experience on a child. 

Marina picked an A-line dress. Or, more precisely, the ladies of Kleinfeld picked it for her. Marina was too shocked to do more than nod. As she took the gown into the dressing room, I tried not to think of my little girl on her wedding day or of her as a baby in my arms. I tried not to think of her with her own baby in her arms one day. 

I tried not to think of Marina right now, embarrassed by her mother's plans, by things she could not and should not yet understand. 

I am leaving money in my will for Marina's wedding dress. Stephanie has promised to bring her back to Kleinfeld to purchase it. 

"No pure white!" I said to Stephanie. "Ivory. Not too much tulle . Think lace." 

"Think royalty when picking a dress," I advised Steph as we waited outside the dressing room. "Think Princes Kate. Elegant. Think long sleeves. They make dresses more formal." 

Marina came out, sleeveless, flared . She looked like a 14-year-old girl in the middle of a giant cupcake. 

"I don't like the loose gown." she said. 

That's my girl! 

"How about trying on one with long sleeves?" I asked her. 

The ladies brought out a dress with long lace sleeves, an Empire collar, a ruched fitted waist, and a long, smooth silk skirt. 

Marina disappeared into the dressing room. When the door opened, she looked a foot taller and a decade older. I could clearly see the beautiful woman she will be one day. I simply stared. 

What do you do when you glimpse a moment you will not live to see? 

I dipped my head. Breathe, I told myself. I looked up. I smiled. Marina smiled back. 

I worked my tongue into position to speak. "I like it," I said. 

In that dress, Marina stood straight, shining brightly, and tall. 

"You are beautiful," I whispered, my tongue barely cooperating. I don't know if she heard me. We took some photos. And moved on. A memory made. [Q:] who had ALS? [A:] I do  [Q:] who did she take to Kleinfeld? [A:] Marina  [Q:] how old is she? [A:] 14  [Q:] was she excited? [A:] No  [Q:] what was she more excited about? [A:] getting a tattoo  [Q:] about what?

Parents might tell older children to "Act your age". But some researchers say that is what persons from thirteen to nineteen years old are doing. While teenagers can look all grown up, studies have shown that their brains are still developing. How much this explains their behavior, though, is a subject of debate. Jay Giedd of America's National Institutes of Health is a leader in this area of research. Doctor Giedd has been studying a group of young people since 1991. They visit him every two years for imaging tests of their brains. He says considerable development continues in young people from the teenage years into the twenties. A part of the brain called the dorsal-lateral prefrontal cortex appears especially undeveloped in teenagers. Researchers believe that this area controls judgment and consideration of risk. So, its underdevelopment may explain why young people seem more willing to take risks like driving too fast. Laurence Steinberg is a psychology professor at Temple University in Philadelphia. He says stronger laws and stronger parental control are needed to protect teens from themselves. That includes raising the age for driving. He says research shows that teenage brains are not fully equipped to control behavior. Other researchers, however, say there is not enough evidence to make a strong case for such findings. Psychologist Robert Epstein is a visiting scholar at the University of California in San Diego. Mr. Epstein notes that teen behavior differs from culture to culture. He says behavior depends for the most part on socialization. He believes that teenagers will demonstrate better, safer behavior if they spend more time with adults, and are treated more like them. But is that always true? Mike Males works at the Center on Juvenile and Criminal Justice in San Francisco. He suggests that all of this talk lately about brainless teens could be an attempt to take away attention from the reality. Writing in the New York Times, he says it is middle-aged adults whose behavior has worsened. In his words, if grown-ups really have superior brains, why don't we act as if we do? [Q:] What is a common saying that parents tell their kids? [A:] "Act your age"  [Q:] Do scientists think it's accurate for parents to say this? [A:] yes  [Q:] Why do teens act immature when they appear to be grown up? [A:] Brain development continues into their twenties  [Q:] What area of the brain is still growing during this time?

CHAPTER VIII 



Five minutes after Paula had left him, punctual to the second, the four telegrams disposed of, Dick was getting into a ranch motor car, along with Thayer, the Idaho buyer, and Naismith, the special correspondent for the _Breeders' Gazette_. Wardman, the sheep manager, joined them at the corrals where several thousand young Shropshire rams had been assembled for inspection. 

There was little need for conversation. Thayer was distinctly disappointed in this, for he felt that the purchase of ten carloads of such expensive creatures was momentous enough to merit much conversation. 

"They speak for themselves," Dick had assured him, and turned aside to give data to Naismith for his impending article on Shropshires in California and the Northwest. 

"I wouldn't advise you to bother to select them," Dick told Thayer ten minutes later. "The average is all top. You could spend a week picking your ten carloads and have no higher grade than if you had taken the first to hand." 

This cool assumption that the sale was already consummated so perturbed Thayer, that, along with the sure knowledge that he had never seen so high a quality of rams, he was nettled into changing his order to twenty carloads. 

As he told Naismith, after they had regained the Big House and as they chalked their cues to finish the interrupted game: 

"It's my first visit to Forrest's. He's a wizard. I've been buying in the East and importing. But those Shropshires won my judgment. You noticed I doubled my order. Those Idaho buyers will be wild for them. I only had buying orders straight for six carloads, and contingent on my judgment for two carloads more; but if every buyer doesn't double his order, straight and contingent, when he sees them rams, and if there isn't a stampede for what's left, I don't know sheep. They're the goods. If they don't jump up the sheep game of Idaho ... well, then Forrest's no breeder and I'm no buyer, that's all."  [Q:] how many telegrams wwere disposed of? [A:] four  [Q:] how long had Paula been gone before he left too. [A:] Five minutes  [Q:] what type of car? [A:] a ranch motor car  [Q:] Along with who? [A:] Thayer  [Q:] how was he described?

(CNN) -- According to the "Guinness Book of World Records," Sherlock Holmes is the most popular role in the movies. 

So if Robert Downey Jr. hardly seems like the iconic Sherlock (he's too short and muscular, and strains to suggest the intellectual arrogance that comes so easily to the English), he can take his place alongside such oddball castings as Buster Keaton, Charlton Heston and George C. Scott. And he's ideally suited to director Guy Ritchie's purpose, which is not to dust off your grandfather's Conan Doyle, but to juice today's kids with a quirky 19th century super sleuth. 

What's fun about these movies is that the equation works both ways. 

Yes, this Holmes is more likely to get physical than his predecessors, he's even a bit of a boor, but he's still a more cerebral action hero than we find in most blockbusters, and the period trappings (a seamless blend of CGI and location work) help this franchise stand out from the crowd of comic book adaptations. 

Ritchie and husband-and-wife screenwriters Kieran and Michele Mulroney ("Paper Man") map out a fast-moving -- if ridiculously digressive -- Victorian adventure that crisscrosses Europe by horseless carriage, train, boat, and, in Sherlock's case, pony. 

Just down the road from 221 Baker Street they're digging a tunnel for what will become the London Underground. The Industrial Age is beginning to stretch its muscles, while a series of terrorist atrocities are gnawing at the fragile understanding between the great European powers. Holmes detects something other than social unrest behind the bombings: an evil master plan leading inexorably to his nemesis, Professor Moriarty (Jared Harris).

(CNN) -- Three Pakistani cricketers found guilty of corruption pleaded for leniency on Wednesday ahead of their sentencing in a British court. 

Former national captain Salman Butt and bowlers Mohammad Asif and Mohammad Amir will discover their fate on Thursday, along with agent Mazhar Majeed. 

Majeed, like Amir, pleaded guilty after being caught accepting money from an undercover newspaper reporter to "spot-fix" outcomes during a Test match against England at Lord's in August 2010. 

Butt and Asif unsuccessfully tried to overturn charges that they both conspired to cheat and accept corrupt funds from Majeed, having been accused of agreeing to deliver three no-ball deliveries at specified times during the match. 

Former Pakistan captain blames ICC for corruption in cricket 

Majeed testified that he gave Asif £65,000 ($103,000) and also paid £10,000 ($16,000) to Butt and £2,500 ($4,000) to Amir after receiving £150,000 ($240,000) from a journalist working for the now defunct News of the World paper. 

The cheating charge carries a maximum sentence of two years plus an unlimited fine, while they could be jailed for seven years with an unlimited fine for accepting corrupt payments. 

Amir, a rising star in the sport at the age of 19, outlined his remorse in a statement read by his lawyer. 

"First I want to apologize to Pakistan and to everyone that cricket is important to," he said. "I do know how much damage this has done to the game, a game which I love more than anything else in the world. 

"I did decide many months ago that I wanted to admit that I deliberately threw two no-balls at the Lord's Test last summer. But I know this was very late and I want to apologize for not saying it before. I didn't find the courage to do it at the beginning, and I know very well that made everything much more difficult."

CHAPTER XVIII 

IN NORWAY AT LAST 

There is no denying the fact that Dave was startled. It was one thing to have Roger missing, it was quite another to have his chum gone and have the berth made up as if it had never been occupied. 

"He went to bed--I saw him go," muttered the boy from the country to himself. "Am I dreaming, or what can the matter be?" 

The more Dave thought over the affair the more was he puzzled. As quickly as he could, he put on some of his clothing and slipped on his shoes. Then he opened the stateroom door and stepped out into the passageway leading to the main saloon. 

There was a dim light burning outside, and nobody appeared to be in sight. Dave looked up and down the passageway eagerly, and even stepped to one of the corners. Then he walked to the main saloon, with its big sofas and easy-chairs, and its grand piano. Not a soul was in sight anywhere. 

"Well, if this isn't the queerest yet," he murmured, and pinched himself, to make certain that he was not dreaming. He walked to one end of the saloon and then to the other, and then started for the stairs leading out on deck. 

At that moment there came an extra-heavy gust of wind and the steamer rocked violently. Dave was thrown on his side and fell headlong over the end of a sofa. As he went down he heard several cries, one in a voice that sounded familiar to him.  [Q:] Who is Dave looking for? [A:] Roger  [Q:] Where is he? [A:] the steamer  [Q:] Is that a boat? [A:] yes  [Q:] Where is Roger? [A:] unknown  [Q:] Did Dave think he was in bed? [A:] no  [Q:] Is his bed made? [A:] yes  [Q:] Was Dave confused? [A:] yes  [Q:] Did he witness him heading to bed? [A:] yes  [Q:] Where did he decide to go? [A:] the main saloon  [Q:] Was anyone there? [A:] no  [Q:] What did he walk through on the way to the saloon? [A:] the passageway  [Q:] Was it bright? [A:] no  [Q:] Who was in the passageway? [A:] nobody  [Q:] What kind of seating choices are in the saloon? [A:] big sofas  [Q:] Any other options? [A:] easy-chairs  [Q:] Is there an instrument? [A:] a grand piano  [Q:] Did he check the whole saloon? [A:] yes  [Q:] What made the boat move? [A:] an extra-heavy gust of wind  [Q:] Did Dave get tossed? [A:] yes  [Q:] Where was he headed before the wind? [A:] stairs leading out on deck
CHAPTER XXX. 

THE MEETING FOR RAIN. 

Meanwhile the Auld Lichts were in church, waiting for their minister, and it was a full meeting, because nearly every well in Thrums had been scooped dry by anxious palms. Yet not all were there to ask God's rain for themselves. Old Charles Yuill was in his pew, after dreaming thrice that he would break up with the drought; and Bell Christison had come, though her man lay dead at home, and she thought it could matter no more to her how things went in the world. 

You, who do not love that little congregation, would have said that they were waiting placidly. But probably so simple a woman as Meggy Rattray could have deceived you into believing that because her eyes were downcast she did not notice who put the three-penny- bit in the plate. A few men were unaware that the bell was working overtime, most of them farmers with their eyes on the windows, but all the women at least were wondering. They knew better, however, than to bring their thoughts to their faces, and none sought to catch another's eye. The men-folk looked heavily at their hats in the seats in front. Even when Hendry Munn, instead of marching to the pulpit with the big Bible in his hands, came as far as the plate and signed to Peter Tosh, elder, that he was wanted in the vestry, you could not have guessed how every woman there, except Bell Christison, wished she was Peter Tosh. Peter was so taken aback that he merely gaped at Hendry, until suddenly he knew that his five daughters were furious with him, when he dived for his hat and staggered to the vestry with his mouth open. His boots cheeped all the way, but no one looked up.  [Q:] Who gaped at Hendry? [A:] Peter  [Q:] How many daughters were there? [A:] five daughters  [Q:] Whose man was dead at home? [A:] Bell Christison's  [Q:] Who were in church? [A:] the Auld Lichts  [Q:] What were they waiting for? [A:] for their minister  [Q:] Was everyone there to ask for rain? [A:] no  [Q:] Who was a simple woman? [A:] Meggy Rattray  [Q:] What were all the women doing? [A:] wondering  [Q:] And what were most of the men? [A:] farmers  [Q:] What did Hendry Munn do? [A:] signed to Peter Tosh  [Q:] Who dove for his hat? [A:] Peter  [Q:] Then where did he go? [A:] the vestry  [Q:] Was the church full when they were waiting? [A:] yes  [Q:] Where was Charles Yuill? [A:] in his pew  [Q:] Did Bell Christison care how things went? [A:] no
Los Angeles (CNN) -- A man convicted of stalking singer Madonna, and who once threatened to knife her, was arrested Friday, a week after he escaped from a Southern California mental hospital, police said. 

Robert Dewey Hoskins, 54, had walked away from Metropolitan State Hospital in the Los Angeles suburb of Norwalk on February 3, police said. 

He had served a 10-year prison sentence for stalking the "Material Girl," police said, and a court order requires him to be in a facility receiving mental health treatment until the end of August 2012. 

Los Angeles Police Sgt. Mitzi Fierro told HLN's Nancy Grace that she hadn't been told whether any new charges will be filed against Hoskins. 

"At this point they are returning him to the facility, and I believe that will be determined by the detectives who will investigate -- number one, his ability to walk away from the facility and, number two, if he violated anything from that point on," Fierro said. 

The facility he was in is not secured, and it was unclear Friday whether Hoskins escaped or walked out on his own, investigators told CNN. 

He was receiving treatment to get acclimated to society again and was supervised by a civilian staff and not officers, detectives said. 

Because of the court order, Hoskins was deemed an "escapee," detectives said. 

Investigators had been looking for him in the Long Beach area because some of his arrest records come from that community, detectives said. 

Prior to his arrest Friday, Los Angeles police issued a warning to the public saying Hoskins "is highly psychotic when not taking his medication and has very violent tendencies."  [Q:] Who was arrested? [A:] Robert Dewey Hoskins,  [Q:] Did he escape from anywhere? [A:] A mental hospital  [Q:] When? [A:] A week before Friday.  [Q:] What was he charged with? [A:] Stalking.  [Q:] Who? [A:] Madonna  [Q:] Who is the police sergeant in Los Angeles? [A:] Mitzi Fierro  [Q:] Was the mental health facility secured? [A:] No.  [Q:] What was he getting help with? [A:] being acclimated to society again.  [Q:] Was he watched over by police? [A:] No.  [Q:] Who then? [A:] Civilian staff.  [Q:] Where were police looking for him at? [A:] the Long Beach area.  [Q:] Was he considered harmless? [A:] No  [Q:] How old is he? [A:] 54  [Q:] How long was he in prison for? [A:] 10 years  [Q:] Which tv anchor was Fierro speaking too? [A:] Nancy Grace  [Q:] Will new charges be filed? [A:] Did not indicate any.
Chapter IX.--THE AUSTRIAN-SAXON ARMY INVADES SILESIA, ACROSS THE MOUNTAINS. 

Valori, who is to be of Friedrich's Campaign this Year, came posting off directly in rear of the glorious news of Fontenoy; found Friedrich at Camenz, rather in spirits than otherwise; and lodged pleasantly with Abbot Tobias and him, till the Campaign should begin. Two things surprise Valori: first, the great strength, impregnable as it were, to which Neisse has been brought since he saw it last,--superlative condition of that Fortress, and of the Army itself, as it gathers daily more and more about Frankenstein here:--and then secondly, and contrariwise, the strangely neglected posture of mountainous or Upper Silesia, given up to Pandours. Quite submerged, in a manner: Margraf Karl lies quiet among them at Jagerndorf, "eating his magazine;" General Hautcharmoi (Winterfeld's late chief in that Wurben affair), with his small Detachment, still hovers about in those Ratibor parts, "with the Strong Towns to fall-back upon," or has in effect fallen back accordingly; and nothing done to coerce the Pandours at all. While Prince Karl and Weissenfels are daily coming on, in force 100,000, their intention certain; force, say, about 100,000 regular! Very singular to Valori. 

"Sire, will not you dispute the Passes, then?" asks Valori, amazed: "Not defend your Mountain rampart, then?" "MON CHER; the Mountain rampart is three or four hundred miles long; there are twelve or twenty practicable roads through it. One is kept in darkness, too; endless Pandour doggery shutting out your daylight:--ill defending such a rampart," answers Friedrich. "But how, then," persists Valori; "but--?" "One day the King answered me," says Valori, "'MON AMI, if you want to get the mouse, don't shut, the trap; leave the trap open (ON LAISSE LA SOURICIERE OUVERTE)!'" Which was a beam of light to the inquiring thought of Valori, a military man of some intelligence. [See VALORI, i. 222, 224, 228.]  [Q:] How long is the Mountain rampart? [A:] three or four hundred miles  [Q:] How many roads does it have? [A:] twelve or twenty  [Q:] Is it well lit? [A:] no  [Q:] What blocks the light?

One sunny May afternoon, a group of teenagers ditched school and went to the mall. June volunteered to drive her friends Ben, Sasha, and Bruce. The teenagers piled into the red car and drove to the mall. When they arrived, Ben and Sasha wanted to go to the sporting goods store. However, Bruce and June wanted to go watch a movie directed by Miranda July. They split up and said they would meet up at the food area later. Three hours later, the friends got back together. Ben and Sasha wanted to leave, so they went back out to the parking lot and got in the car. When June backed out of the parking spot, she scraped the car next to her. Sasha said it was okay, but Bruce said June needed to leave a note for the driver of the other car. Just then, the other driver appeared. They called the police to get an accident report. When the police arrived, they put Ben and Sasha in handcuffs because they had been stealing. They had to volunteer every week until October. [Q:] Where did the teenagers go? [A:] the mall  [Q:] Instead of where? [A:] school  [Q:] Who drove? [A:] June  [Q:] How many passengers did she have? [A:] three  [Q:] What was the weather like?

It was only in the 1980s that digital telephony transmission networks became possible, such as with ISDN networks, assuring a minimum bit rate (usually 128 kilobits/s) for compressed video and audio transmission. During this time, there was also research into other forms of digital video and audio communication. Many of these technologies, such as the Media space, are not as widely used today as videoconferencing but were still an important area of research. The first dedicated systems started to appear in the market as ISDN networks were expanding throughout the world. One of the first commercial videoconferencing systems sold to companies came from PictureTel Corp., which had an Initial Public Offering in November, 1984. 

The MC controls the conferencing while it is active on the signaling plane, which is simply where the system manages conferencing creation, endpoint signaling and in-conferencing controls. This component negotiates parameters with every endpoint in the network and controls conferencing resources. While the MC controls resources and signaling negotiations, the MP operates on the media plane and receives media from each endpoint. The MP generates output streams from each endpoint and redirects the information to other endpoints in the conference. [Q:] What company had an IPO in 1984?

CHAPTER VIII. 

HOSTAGE. 

The revolution of Todos Santos had to all appearances been effected as peacefully as the gentle Liberator of Quinquinambo could have wished. Two pronunciamientos, rudely printed and posted in the Plaza, and saluted by the fickle garrison of one hundred men, who had, however, immediately reappointed their old commander as Generalissimo under the new regime, seemed to leave nothing to be desired. A surging mob of vacant and wondering peons, bearing a singular resemblance to the wild cattle and horses which intermingled with them in blind and unceasing movement across the Plaza and up the hilly street, and seemingly as incapable of self-government, were alternately dispersed and stampeded or allowed to gather again as occasion required. Some of these heterogeneous bands were afterwards found--the revolution accomplished--gazing stupidly on the sea, or ruminating in bovine wantonness on the glacis before the Presidio. 

Eleanor Keene, who with her countrywomen had been hurried to the refuge of the Mission, was more disturbed and excited at the prospect of meeting Hurlstone again than by any terror of the insurrection. But Hurlstone was not there, and Father Esteban received her with a coldness she could not attribute entirely to her countrymen's supposed sympathy with the insurgents. When Richard Keene, who would not leave his sister until he had seen her safe under the Mission walls, ventured at her suggestion to ask after the American recluse, Father Esteban replied dryly that, being a Christian gentleman, Hurlstone was the only one who had the boldness to seek out the American filibuster Perkins, on his own ship, and remonstrate with him for his unholy crusade. For the old priest had already become aware of Hurlstone's blunder, and he hated Eleanor as the primary cause of the trouble. But for her, Diego would be still with him in this emergency.

(CNN) -- A 16-year-old Pennsylvania boy is facing murder charges, accused of fatally shooting a cab driver who he believed was intentionally taking a longer route to his destination. 

Aazis Richardson is accused of shooting the cab driver, Vincent Darbenzio, 47, twice in the back of his head while still in the cab, according to Lackawanna County Assistant District Attorney Gene Talerico. 

Richardson believed Darbenzio had ignored his route suggestions in attempt to increase the fare, according to Talerico. 

"I just told him, 'take this way;' he didn't want to listen -- he got his (expletive) shot," Richardson told CNN affiliate WNEP. 

Calls and e-mails to the Lackawanna County public defender's office, which is representing Richardson, were not immediately returned. 

As Richardson was being taken away, he showed no remorse for the driver or his family telling WNEP, "my homies died, everybody gotta die." 

Richardson was charged as an adult with multiple counts of murder in the first, second and third degrees, as well as robbery and firearms-related offenses, according Talerico. 

On Sunday, more than 50 of Darbenzio's friends and family members held a vigil near the spot where Darbenzio was killed, according to the victim's brother, Chris Darbenzio. 

Richardson is currently being held without bail at the Lackawanna County Prison, according to the district attorney's office.

There once was a pumpkin. The pumpkin was sad. The pumpkin wanted to leave the garden and see the world. But the pumpkin had to stay in the garden because its vine held it there. One day a fox came by. The pumpkin asked the fox to cut the vine so the pumpkin could leave the garden. The fox said it would cut the vine so the pumpkin could leave the garden. When the fox cut the vine the pumpkin could roll around. The pumpkin rolled around until it got out of the garden. First it met a cat. It told the cat it was happy because now it could see the world. The cat gave the pumpkin a piece of cake to eat. The pumpkin could not eat the cake because it had no mouth but it was still very happy to have the cat as a new friend. [Q:] There was once a what?

The Soviet Union, officially the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR, Russian: СССР), was a socialist state in Eurasia that existed from 1922 to 1991. Nominally a union of multiple equal national Soviet republics, its government and economy were highly centralized. The country was a one-party state, governed by the Communist Party with Moscow as its capital in its largest republic, the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic. The Russian nation had constitutionally equal status among the many nations of the union but exerted de facto dominance in various respects. Other major urban centres were Leningrad, Kiev, Minsk, Alma-Ata and Novosibirsk. The Soviet Union was one of the five recognized nuclear weapons states and possessed the largest stockpile of weapons of mass destruction. It was a founding permanent member of the United Nations Security Council, as well as a member of the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE), and the leading member of the Council for Mutual Economic Assistance (CMEA) and the Warsaw Pact. 

The Soviet Union had its roots in the October Revolution of 1917, when the Bolsheviks, led by Vladimir Lenin, overthrew the Russian Provisional Government which had replaced Tsar Nicholas II during World War I. In 1922, the Soviet Union was formed with the unification of the Russian, Transcaucasian, Ukrainian, and Byelorussian republics. Following Lenin's death in 1924 and a brief power struggle, Joseph Stalin came to power in the mid-1920s. Stalin committed the state's ideology to Marxism–Leninism (which he created), and initiated a centrally planned economy which led to a period of rapid industrialization and collectivization. During this period of totalitarian rule, Stalin imposed political paranoia; the mid-1930s Great Purge removed his opponents within and outside of the party via arbitrary arrests and persecutions of many people. Suppression of political critics, forced labor, and famines were perpetrated by Stalin; in 1933, a major famine struck Soviet Ukraine, causing the deaths of over 7 million people.

ChiChi weighs only 13 pounds. "He's so tiny,I can carry him with one hand," says Mary Lane."Most people see him and think he's useless." 

But last October,ChiChi proved to be more than just a pretty face. Mary and her husband,Rick,were relaxing on the beach one afternoon while on vacation in North Carolina's Outer Banks.As usual,ChiChi was lying on his blanket in his own little beach chair. 

"We had our noses buried in books,"recalls Rick,"when suddenly the dog became extremely uneasy. His bark was different from anything we had heard before.And he would not let us ignore him." 

ChiChi ran back and forth in front of his chair as if to run down the beach.The Lanes sat up to see two elderly women in the ocean,about 100 yards down the beach and 10 feet off shore.One was on her back,her head under the waves.The other was struggling hard to keep her friend's head above the surface. 

The Lanes rushed across the sand and into the surf. Rick went to the woman in danger of drowning,while Mary held fast on to the other one and pulled her up on the beach."Then I went back to help Rick," Mary says."The sand dropped off steeply,and a riptide was beating the woman under. She was completely helpless." 

Not getting well from recent knee surgery,the woman had been unable to turn over or push herself up."Her friend had been in danger too," Mary says."The waves were pushing her around. There's no way she could have held on much longer." 

The women hadn't called out for help. "They were struggling so hard that there was no time for screaming," Mary recalls."But ChiChi had sensed their danger." 

Duty done,ChiChi was back in his chair,asleep,by the time the two women were on dry ground and the Lanes had returned to their blankets.Luckily,the women were fine,though shaken.They thanked the Lanes for saving their lives. 

Back home in Greensboro,North Carolina,the Lanes ordered a special collar with the words "Hero Dog" on it. [Q:] Is ChiChi a person? [A:] no  [Q:] What is he? [A:] a dog  [Q:] Is he large?

CHAPTER XIII. 

"_Benedict_. What, my dear Lady Disdain, are you yet living?" 

"_Beatrice_. Is it possible Disdain should die while she has such meet food to feed her?" 

_Much Ado about Nothing._ 

The Lyddell family did not continue in London much longer; it had been a short season, and though the session of Parliament was not over, most of the ladies were taking flight into the country, before the end of June,--Mrs. Lyddell among the rest,--and her husband went backwards and forwards to London, as occasion called him. 

The girls were glad to get into the country, but Marian soon found that she had not escaped either from gaieties, or from the objects of her aversion; for Mr. Faulkner brought his mother and sisters to High Down House, gave numerous parties there, and made a constant interchange of civilities with the family at Oakworthy. Archery was pretty much the fashion with the young ladies that year; it was a sport which Marian liked particularly, having often practised it with Edmund and Agnes, and her bow and arrows were always the first to be ready. 

One day when Marian, Caroline, and Clara were shooting on the lawn at Oakworthy, Mr. and Miss Faulkner rode from High Down, came out on the lawn, and joined them. From that moment, any one could see the change that came over Marian. Instead of laughing and talking, teaching Clara, and paying only half attention to her own shooting, she now went on as if it was her sole object, and as if she had no other purpose in life. She fixed her arrows and twanged her string with a rigidity as if the target had been a deadly enemy, or her whole fate was concentrated in hitting the bull's eye; and when her arrows went straight to the mark, or at least much straighter than those of any one else, she never turned her head, or vouchsafed more than the briefest answer to the exclamations around.

Mumbai (; also known as Bombay, the official name until 1995) is the capital city of the Indian state of Maharashtra. It is the most populous city in India with an estimated city population of 18.4 million. Along with the neighbouring regions of the Mumbai Metropolitan Region, it is second most populous metropolitan area in India, with a population of 21.3 million . Mumbai lies on the Konkan on the west coast of India and has a deep natural harbour. 

In 2008, Mumbai was named an alpha world city. It is also the wealthiest city in India, Mumbai has the highest number of millionaires and billionaires among all cities in India. 

The seven islands that came to constitute Mumbai were home to communities of fishing colonies of the Koli people. For centuries, the islands were under the control of successive indigenous empires before being ceded to the Portuguese Empire and subsequently to the East India Company when in 1661 Charles II of England married Catherine of Braganza and as part of her dowry Charles received the ports of Tangier and Seven Islands of Bombay. During the mid-18th century, Bombay was reshaped by the Hornby Vellard project, which undertook reclamation of the area between the seven islands from the sea. Along with construction of major roads and railways, the reclamation project, completed in 1845, transformed Bombay into a major seaport on the Arabian Sea. Bombay in the 19th century was characterised by economic and educational development. During the early 20th century it became a strong base for the Indian independence movement. Upon India's independence in 1947 the city was incorporated into Bombay State. In 1960, following the Samyukta Maharashtra Movement, a new state of Maharashtra was created with Bombay as the capital.

CHAPTER II 

THE RULERS OF FRANCE 

Great activity reigned in the corridors and kitchens of the old château. M. le Chef--the only true rival the immortal Vatel ever had--in white cap and apron, calm and self-possessed as a field-marshal in the hour of victory, and surrounded by an army of scullions and wenches, was directing the operations of dishing-up--the crowning glory of his arduous labours. Pies and patties, haunches of venison, trout and carp from the Rhine were placed on gold and silver dishes and adorned with tasteful ornaments of truly architectural beauty and monumental proportions. These were then handed over to the footmen, who, resplendent in gorgeous liveries of scarlet and azure, hurried along the marble passages carrying the masterpieces of culinary art to the banqueting-hall beyond, whilst the butlers, more sedate and dignified in sober garb of puce or brown, stalked along in stately repose bearing the huge tankards and crystal jugs. 

All of the best that the fine old Château d'Aumont could provide was being requisitioned to-night, since M. le Duc and Mlle. Lydie, his daughter, were giving a farewell banquet to Charles Edward Stuart by the grace of God--if not by the will of the people--King of Great Britain and Ireland and all her dependencies beyond the seas. 

For him speeches were made, toasts drunk and glasses raised; for him the ducal veneries had been ransacked, the ducal cellars shorn of their most ancient possessions; for him M. le Chef had raged and stormed for five hours, had expended the sweat of his brow and the intricacies of his brain; for him the scullions' backs had smarted, the wenches' cheeks had glowed, all to do honour to the only rightful King of England about to quit the hospitable land of France in order to conquer that island kingdom which his grandfather had lost.  [Q:] Where was the banquet being held? [A:] the old château  [Q:] what was it called? [A:] Château d'Aumont  [Q:] who was throwing the party? [A:] M. le Duc and Mlle. Lydie  [Q:] for whom?

CHAPTER VI 

About five o'clock that afternoon Ephraim was sitting in his shirt-sleeves by the window of his room, and Cynthia was reading aloud to him an article (about the war, of course) from a Washington paper, which his friend, Mr. Beard, had sent him. There was a knock at the door, and Cynthia opened it to discover a colored hall-boy with a roll in his hand. 

"Mistah Ephum Prescott?" he said. 

"Yes," answered Ephraim, "that's me." 

Cynthia shut the door and gave him the roll, but Ephraim took it as though he were afraid of its contents. 

"Guess it's some of them war records from Amasy," he said. 

"Oh, Cousin Eph," exclaimed Cynthia, excitedly, "why don't you open it? If you don't I will." 

"Guess you'd better, Cynthy," and he held it out to her with a trembling hand. 

Cynthia did open it, and drew out a large document with seals and printing and signatures. 

"Cousin Eph," she cried, holding it under his nose, "Cousin Eph, you're postmaster of Brampton!" 

Ephraim looked at the paper, but his eyes swam, and he could only make out a dancing, bronze seal. 

"I want to know!" he exclaimed. "Fetch Jethro." 

But Cynthia had already flown on that errand. Curiously enough, she ran into Jethro in the hall immediately outside of Ephraim's door. Ephraim got to his feet; it was very difficult for him to realize that his troubles were ended, that he was to earn his living at last. He looked at Jethro, and his eyes filled with tears. "I guess I can't thank you as I'd ought to, Jethro," he said, "leastways, not now."  [Q:] What did Cynthia;s name get shortened to? [A:] Cynthy  [Q:] who did she go to find? [A:] Jethro  [Q:] did she walk sedately? [A:] no  [Q:] Did Ephram have a jacket on? [A:] no  [Q:] what time was it? [A:] About five o'clock  [Q:] and where was he sat?

(CNN) -- Marathon man John Isner survived another epic on his return to competitive tennis after his record-breaking 11-hour Wimbledon match. 

The American saved two match points before beating Gilles Muller, from Luxembourg, 4-6 7-6 7-6 to seal his place in the quarterfinals of the Atlanta Tennis Championships. 

It is Isner's first tournament since Wimbledon back in June when his opening round victory over Frenchman Nicolas Mahut in London clocked in as the longest match in tennis history. 

Isner's battle with Mahut stretched over three days and 183 games before he finally triumphed, 6-4 3-6 6-7 7-6 70-68. He later told CNN: "I really didn't think it was going to end." 

Isner reflects on 'crazy' Wimbledon match 

The match turned Isner into a household name in the sport, and after his straight sets defeat to Thiemo de Bakker in the second round the 25-year-old targeted a prolonged period of rest. 

But on his return to the court he was made to work hard by Muller, saving two match points and firing 33 aces as he won in two-and-a-half hours to delight the 5,000 strong crowd. 

"I didn't want to let [the fans] down," Isner told the ATP tour website. "I didn't want to lose my first match here. Also, I had a lot of friends and family here, so I didn't want to go out early. 

"I hadn't seen a live ball in quite some time and Gilles was never going to give me rhythm with his lefty serve. I felt I was shedding the rust off in the second and third sets. I will only keep getting better.  [Q:] who did not want to let down fans ? [A:] Isner  [Q:] was it his 2nd match since Wimbledon ? [A:] no  [Q:] what is the correct answer ?

New Haven (local /nuː ˈheɪvən/, noo-HAY-vən), in the U.S. state of Connecticut, is the principal municipality in Greater New Haven, which had a total population of 862,477 in 2010. It is located on New Haven Harbor on the northern shore of the Long Island Sound in New Haven County, Connecticut, which in turn comprises the outer limits of the New York metropolitan area. It is the second-largest city in Connecticut (after Bridgeport), with a population of 129,779 people as of the 2010 United States Census. According to a census of 1 July 2012, by the Census Bureau, the city had a population of 130,741. 

In 1637 a small party of Puritans reconnoitered the New Haven harbor area and wintered over. In April 1638, the main party of five hundred Puritans who left the Massachusetts Bay Colony under the leadership of the Reverend John Davenport and the London merchant Theophilus Eaton sailed into the harbor. These settlers were hoping to establish a (in their mind) better theological community, with the government more closely linked to the church than the one they left in Massachusetts and sought to take advantage of the excellent port capabilities of the harbor. The Quinnipiacs, who were under attack by neighboring Pequots, sold their land to the settlers in return for protection. [Q:] What is the city of focus? [A:] New Haven  [Q:] What was it's population in 2012? [A:] 130,741  [Q:] When was that census held? [A:] 1 July 2012  [Q:] In what year did the Puritans winter there?

CHAPTER XIII. 

A JOYFUL MEETING. 

It is highly probable that one might have searched over New York City that night and not found a happier household than that of Mrs. Green's. Paul was so wonderfully happy in the thought that he was going back to Chicago, where, even though he could not see his parents, he should find relatives and friends, that he could talk of little else. Even the theatre was forgotten by him; for when Mopsey spoke of the necessity of getting another boy to take his place in the dramatic company he hardly gave the matter a thought, except to say that he hoped they would make plenty of money out of it. And Paul's partners were happy, more happy than they could possibly have been by any other outlay of their money; Paul's pleasure reflected on them to such a degree that they became almost as much excited as he was before the evening was over. 

Good Mrs. Green alternately laughed and cried, until she seemed to realize that such nervousness was not exactly suitable to the occasion, and then she busied herself by reading one of the papers Ben had brought home. 

Master Treat had spent so much time on the good work he had carried through so successfully, and then had paid so much more attention to the boy he was going to surprise than to the sale of his goods, that, instead of helping Johnny as had been his purpose when he took some of his papers to sell, he was a drawback, and the consequence was that Mrs. Green had three evening papers to read, while Messrs. Jones and Treat had been "stuck" just that number.  [Q:] what chapter is this? [A:] XIII.  [Q:] whose house was happy? [A:] Mrs. Green's  [Q:] in what city [A:] New York City  [Q:] Was Paul happy to leave? [A:] yes  [Q:] to go where/. [A:] Chicago  [Q:] could he see his parents there?

MedlinePlus is an online information service produced by the United States National Library of Medicine. The service provides curated consumer health information in English and Spanish. The site street together information from the National Library of Medicine (NLM), the National Institutes of Health (NIH), other U.S. government agencies, and health-related organizations. There is also a site optimized for display on mobile devices, in both English and Spanish. In 2015, about 400 million people from around the world used MedlinePlus. The service is funded by the NLM and is free to users. 

MedlinePlus provides encyclopedic information on health and drug issues, and provides a directory of medical services. MedlinePlus Connect links patients or providers in electronic health record (EHR) systems to related MedlinePlus information on conditions or medications. 

PubMed Health is another NLM site that offers consumer health information, in addition to information for health professionals. 

The National Library of Medicine has long provided programs and services for professional medical scientists and health care providers, including MEDLINE and the various services that access it, such as PubMed and Entrez. By the 1990s, more members of the general public were using these services as Internet access became widespread. But nonprofessional users could benefit from reliable health information in a layperson-accessible format. The National Library of Medicine introduced MedlinePlus in October 1998, to provide a non-commercial online service similar, for example, to the commercial WebMD. In 2010 another NCBI service, PubMed Health, complemented MedlinePlus in offering curated consumer health information; PubMed Health focuses especially on finding information about clinical effectiveness of treatments.

Tom Brennan was working in a Philadelphia office building when he noticed a black bag. The bag contained a book. This chance discovery ended a 12-day search by the Library Company of Philadelphia for a historical treasure - a 120-page diary kept 190 years ago by Deborah Logan, "a woman who knew everybody in her day," James Green, the librarian told the magazine American Libraries. Most of the diary is a record of big events in Philadelphia. It also includes a description of British soldiers burning Washington, D.C. in the war of 1812. She describes President James Madison on horseback as "perfectly shaking with fear" during the troubled days. George Washington, she writes, mistook her for the wife of a French man, and praised her excellent English. The adventure of the lost book began September 4 when Cory Luxmoore arrived from England to deliver the diary of his ancestor to the Library Company, which he and his wife considered to be the best home for the diary. Green told American Libraries he had the diary in his possession "about five minutes" when Luxmoore took it back because he had promised to show it to one other person. On returning to his hotel after showing the precious book to Green, Luxmoore was shocked to realize that he had left it in the taxi. Without any delay, Green began calling every taxi company in the city, with no luck. "I've felt sick since then," Luxmoore told reporters. According to Green, no one has yet learned how the diary came to the office building. Tom Brennan received a reward of $ 1,000, Philadelphia gained another treasure for its history, and Luxmoore told reporters, "It's wonderful news. I'm on high." [Q:] What was in the bag? [A:] A book.  [Q:] What type of book? [A:] A diary.  [Q:] Whose diary was it? [A:] Deborah Logan's  [Q:] How long did it take the library to find it? [A:] 12 days.  [Q:] How old was the diary? [A:] 190 years old  [Q:] What was recorded in the diary? [A:] Mostly big events in Philadelphia.  [Q:] What else? [A:] A description of British soldiers burning Washington, D.C.  [Q:] What did George Washington think of Deborah's command of the English language? [A:] Excellent English.  [Q:] Why did he praise her for her excellence? [A:] Mistook her for the wife of a French man  [Q:] Who made the trip from England to the US? [A:] Cory Luxmoore  [Q:] Why did he make the trip? [A:] To deliver the diary.

(CNN) -- Engulfed by the darkness of doping's "white noise", he emerged the other side to become a beacon in cycling's anti-drugs fight. 

And in a sport where the tainted legacies of former Tour de France champions Lance Armstrong and Jan Ulrich continue to cast a dark shadow, reformed rider David Millar can see a light at the end of the tunnel. 

He has come a long way since nine years ago when he was was sitting in a Biarritz restaurant in south west France. 

Millar was having dinner with Dave Brailsford, now performance director at British Cycling and Team Sky, when French police arrived to arrest the cyclist, throwing him in a cell and outing him as a drugs cheat. 

A two-year ban from competition followed and, after a Damascene conversion, he returned to the sport a reformed character determined to remove the stain of doping from cycling. 

"I was a fervent anti-doper," the Malta-born Scot, who spent his formative years in England and Hong Kong, told CNN's Changing Gear series before the start of the 2013 Tour de France. 

"I was a naive kid who came from Hong Kong, who dreamed of winning the Tour de France and who was disgusted to learn that my colleagues were doping, but within four or five years I was one of them."

There was once a small, grey cat that lived in the woods. This was a lonely old cat that spent most of his time bullying other small animals that lived in the woods. Almost all of the other little animals who lived in the woods knew of the old cat, and warned everyone they knew to stay away from him. 

One day a young mouse was out taking a walk to collect some berries. It was a nice day out, so the mouse chose to go down by the river to take a quick rest for a bit. When the mouse arrived at the river he found the perfect spot to rest. It was a small little area with soft sand to lie on, under a tree that gave a bit of shade. The mouse then sat back. After a little bit of time the mouse was fast asleep. 

Not long after the mouse had fallen asleep, the cat caught a scent in the air of the young mouse. The cat walked slowly up to the spot where the mouse was sleeping and licked his lips. Right when the cat was about to catch the mouse, the mouse woke up. 

"What are you doing?!" asked the mouse in surprise. 

"I am trying to find dinner," said the cat. 

The mouse smiled. "I collected extra berries today on my walk. Would you like to have some?" 

The cat was confused. He had never been given such a kind thing. "Well, OK. Berries are not my favorite, but I guess that they are OK." 

The cat and mouse then sat down together and ate a meal of tasty berries. It turned out that the cat was not so terrible after all-but had never been given kindness. [Q:] What color was the cat?

Representative democracy (also indirect democracy, representative republic, or psephocracy) is a type of democracy founded on the principle of elected officials representing a group of people, as opposed to direct democracy. Nearly all modern Western-style democracies are types of representative democracies; for example, the United Kingdom is a constitutional monarchy, Ireland is a unitary parliamentary republic, and the United States is a federal republic. 

It is an element of both the parliamentary and the presidential systems of government and is typically used in a lower chamber such as the House of Commons (United Kingdom) or Dáil Éireann (Republic of Ireland), and may be curtailed by constitutional constraints such as an upper chamber. It has been described by some political theorists including Robert A. Dahl, Gregory Houston and Ian Liebenberg as polyarchy. In it the power is in the hands of the elected representatives who are elected by the people in elections. 

Representatives are elected by the public, as in national elections for the national legislature. Elected representatives may hold the power to select other representatives, presidents, or other officers of the government or of the legislature, as the Prime Minister in the latter case. (indirect representation).

Pain is a distressing feeling often caused by intense or damaging stimuli, such as stubbing a toe, burning a finger, putting alcohol on a cut, and bumping the "funny bone". Because it is a complex, subjective phenomenon, defining pain has been a challenge. The International Association for the Study of Pain's widely used definition states: "Pain is an unpleasant sensory and emotional experience associated with actual or potential tissue damage, or described in terms of such damage." In medical diagnosis, pain is a symptom. 

Pain is the most common reason for physician consultation in most developed countries. It is a major symptom in many medical conditions, and can interfere with a person's quality of life and general functioning. Psychological factors such as social support, hypnotic suggestion, excitement, or distraction can significantly affect pain's intensity or unpleasantness. In some arguments put forth in physician-assisted suicide or euthanasia debates, pain has been used as an argument to permit terminally ill patients to end their lives.

Mike wanted to make a cake for his Mom's birthday. His dad was going to help him. Mike had eggs, milk, and flour at his house, but no sugar! Dad told Mike to take his bicycle to the store so he could buy sugar for the cake. On his way to the store, Mike saw his friend, Sally, at the park. He rode over to say hello. Mike and Sally played lots of games at the park. After a long time, Mike saw it was starting to get dark. He needed to hurry if he was going to make it to the store and get home before night time. Mike rode as fast as he could, and made it to the store. The store was really big, but Mike found the sugar really fast. When Mike was on his way to the front of the store to pay for the sugar, he saw a toy he had been wanting for a long time. But Mike only had enough money to pay for the sugar or the toy. Mike didn't know what to do! The cake would taste good and would make his mom happy. But, the toy was so cool! Mike bought the sugar for his mom's cake, because she was always so nice to him.

(CNN) -- Chelsea's star striker Didier Drogba has been suffering from malaria, his club manager revealed on Tuesday, but the Ivory Coast player will still line up for the London derby against Fulham in the English Premier League on Wednesday. 

Drogba started on the bench for Chelsea's 2-0 defeat to Liverpool on Sunday, having missed recent matches against Aston Villa and Spartak Moscow due to a suspected virus. 

However, the results of blood tests showed that he had in fact contracted the tropical disease. 

"A test showed malaria," Chelsea manager Carlo Ancelotti told his club's official website. "He lost his condition, he lost power. 

"Didier had a difficulty to train because he didn't feel good, he didn't have power to train. He was unselfish to play also when he was not 100 percent." 

But the Italian said Drogba was now back to health and would be fit for the league leaders' home clash with Fulham on Wednesday. 

"He suffered obviously but after treatment, he will be better," Ancelotti said. "One time it was serious, now there is the possibility to treat and come back well. He is okay. Tomorrow he will play." 

Ancelotti said Ghana midfielder Michael Essien would return to the Chelsea line-up, having missed the Liverpool game with a toe problem, but Frank Lampard is not yet ready to make his long-awaited return. 

The England midfielder, who has been sidelined following a hernia operation, is scheduled to make his comeback against Sunderland on Sunday. 

"Lampard has been training with us and he is good. He is able to play; he is fit because he worked very hard physically," Ancelotti said.  [Q:] Who had malaria?

CHAPTER XI: Free. 

It was late at night before Blois was reached, and having alighted at the Aigle d'Or they engaged a private room. 

"Even the Duke of Chateaurouge will be satisfied," Ronald said, "that his schemes have failed, and that no more can be done just at present. It will be a bitter blow to him when those scoundrels, on their return to Paris, report their utter failure, for he must have considered it impossible that we could escape from the toils he had laid for us. I only wish that we had clear evidence that he is the author of these attempts. If so, I would go straight with Marshal Saxe and lay an accusation against him before the king; but however certain we may feel about it, we have really nothing to connect him with the affair, and it would be madness to accuse a king's favourite unless one could prove absolutely the truth of what one says. However, I hope some day that I shall get even with him. It will not be my fault if I do not." 

That night Ronald and his mother debated what would be the best way to proceed in the morning, and finally they agreed that Malcolm should present himself at the prison with the order of release, and that they should remain at the hotel, to which Malcolm should bring Colonel Leslie, after breaking to him the news that his wife and son were both awaiting him. The shock, in any case, of sudden liberty, would be a severe one, and the meeting with his attached comrade would act as a preparation for that with his wife.  [Q:] What is the title of this chapter?

Los Angeles (CNN) -- Two years after his death, music legend and celebrity icon Michael Jackson's legacy remains clouded by the debate over how he died and who, if anyone, is to blame. 

A Los Angeles coroner ruled that a surgical anesthetic called Propofol killed the then 50-year-old Jackson, in combination with several sedatives found in his blood, on June 25, 2009. 

Ever since, there have been ongoing efforts -- from awards to statues to new songs -- to keep his memory, and music, alive. Still, much of the talk about one of the world's most celebrated singers has occurred in courtrooms, centered around a host of cases related to his untimely death. 

Authorities claim that his personal doctor, Conrad Murray, administered the fatal dose. He has been charged with involuntary manslaughter in the singer's death. The doctor's defense attorney, Ed Chernoff, contends Jackson was "a desperate man in many respects" and gave himself the fatal dose of surgical anesthesia while the doctor was not watching. 

One of Michael's sisters, LaToya Jackson, told CNN's Piers Morgan this week that her brother "told me that they were going to murder him" -- identifying "they" only as "the people involved in his life, the people that were controlling him." 

The late singer's father, Joe Jackson, also fingered unidentified individuals in an interview with CNN on Saturday. 

"We're striving for justice, because there's more to it than they're claiming," said Joe Jackson, who has filed a wrongful death lawsuit against Murray and also said he's still fighting over who controls his son's estate. "There is somebody else involved."  [Q:] What year did MJ die? [A:] 2009  [Q:] What drug killed him? [A:] Propofol  [Q:] is it an OTC drug? [A:] No  [Q:] What type is it? [A:] a surgical anesthetic  [Q:] Who gave it to him? [A:] Conrad Murray  [Q:] How was e linked to MJ? [A:] his personal doctor  [Q:] Did he get in trouble for it?

[A:] No  [Q:] Who doe he claim gave it? [A:] Michael Jackson himself  [Q:] Does someone claim he was murdered? [A:] yes  [Q:] who? [A:] One of Michael's sisters,  [Q:] Which sister? [A:] LaToya Jackson  [Q:] What date did he die? [A:] 25  [Q:] of what month? [A:] June  [Q:] What was his occupation? [A:] Singer  [Q:] Is there certainty surrounding his death? [A:] No
(CNN) -- A friend of mine who works in advertising recently got called for a job in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. Knowing I have traveled in the Middle East, she asked me if she should take it. I said it might be interesting in terms of cultural anthropology, but don't expect to enjoy yourself. The social and legal restrictions on women are rampant. 

In the end she turned it down, and one big reason was her trepidation about how she would be treated. 

Western women work in the notoriously misogynistic Gulf States, mostly in PR for governments and doing business with multinationals. But the biggest contingent of foreign women working in those countries -- the millions of Bangladeshi, Indonesian and Filipino servants -- are off the radar. The events of this past week should be regarded as their, and the native women's, silent scream. 

Marte Deborah Dalelv, an interior designer working in Qatar, reported being raped last year while on a business trip to Dubai. Although her alleged attacker was arrested and jailed, so was she. A court sentenced her to 16 months in prison for having unlawful sex. 

World outrage at the Kafkaesque situation apparently provoked the Dubai potentate Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum to "pardon" Dalelv. She gets her passport back and is free to go home. She told reporters in Dubai she planned to get out soon. 

The incident should be a wake-up call for any woman, and any man who cares about women, working in or doing business with the petro-cash soaked Gulf States.  [Q:] Who got a job? [A:] A friend  [Q:] Where? [A:] Riyadh, Saudi Arabia  [Q:] Do women have full rights there? [A:] no  [Q:] How many servant nationalities are mentioned? [A:] three  [Q:] What are they?

[A:] Qatar  [Q:] Where did she go for her occupation? [A:] Dubai  [Q:] Was she a victim? [A:] yes  [Q:] Where did she end up? [A:] prison  [Q:] Why? [A:] for having unlawful sex  [Q:] How long was she supposed to be there? [A:] 16 months  [Q:] Who is the ruler there? [A:] Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum  [Q:] What did he do to fix the situation? [A:] pardoned her  [Q:] Why? [A:] World outrage  [Q:] Is she staying in the area? [A:] unknown  [Q:] What does she get back in her possession? [A:] her passport  [Q:] Can she leave? [A:] yes  [Q:] Should men be concerned about this? [A:] yes
The Achaemenid Empire, also called the First Persian Empire, was an empire based in Western Asia, founded by Cyrus the Great. Ranging at its greatest extent from the Balkans and Eastern Europe proper in the west to the Indus Valley in the east, it was one of the largest empires in history, spanning 5.5 million square kilometers, and was larger than any previous empire in history. It is equally notable for its successful model of a centralised, bureaucratic administration (through satraps under the King of Kings), for building infrastructure such as road systems and a postal system, the use of an official language across its territories, and the development of civil services and a large professional army. The empire's successes inspired similar systems in later empires. It is noted in Western history as the antagonist of the Greek city-states during the Greco-Persian Wars and for the emancipation of the Jewish exiles in Babylon. 

By the 7th century BC, the Persians had settled in the southwestern portion of the Iranian Plateau in the region of Persis, which came to be their . From this region, Cyrus the Great advanced to defeat the Medes, Lydia, and the Neo-Babylonian Empire, establishing the Achaemenid Empire. Alexander the Great, an avid admirer of Cyrus the Great, conquered most of the empire by 330 BC. Upon his death, most of the empire's former territory came under the rule of the Ptolemaic Kingdom and Seleucid Empire, in addition to other minor territories which gained independence at that time. The Iranian population of the central plateau reclaimed power by the second century BC under the Parthian Empire. [Q:] What's another name for the First Persian Empire?

CHAPTER X 

BRINGING IN SOME GAME 

The snowstorm proved such a heavy one that for three days the party at Professor Jeffer's cabin were completely stormbound. Once Andy and Chet went out--in an endeavor to bring the dead moose in, but were unable to accomplish their object. 

During the time spent at the cabin, the boys became very well acquainted with Barwell Dawson, and found the hunter and explorer a person very much to their liking. Although he was rich and well educated, he did not act as if he considered himself above them. He took a lively interest in all they had to tell, and knew how to "draw them out," so that, almost before he knew it, Andy had related the details of his troubles with his shiftless Uncle Si and with the mysterious Mr. A. Q. Hopton. 

"More than likely that fellow, Hopton, will bear close watching," said Barwell Dawson. "If he is a sharper--and it looks as if he might be--he will try to swindle both you and your uncle. It was very unwise for your uncle to try to do business with him without seeing a lawyer." 

"Uncle Si wanted to get the money without my knowing it," answered Andy, bitterly. He was glad to open his heart to somebody who could understand him. 

"I believe you--and that is not to your uncle's credit. You say he is shiftless and lazy?" 

"Very--and everybody around here knows it." 

"Then he is not fit to be your guardian."  [Q:] What had happened for three days? [A:] a snowstorm  [Q:] How bad was it? [A:] it was heavy  [Q:] where were they?

Sarah's New Kitty 

"Meow." 

Sarah eyes opened wide when she heard that sound coming from the basket her mother was holding. 

"Mama, what's that sound? It sounds like a kitty!" she said to her mother as she tried to reach the basket. Her mother was holding it up too high for Sarah to reach. 

"Sarah," her mother said, "remember I told you that maybe we can get a pet if you could take good care of it? Well, you're seven years old now and I think you're ready for a special present." 

Sarah's mother set the basket on the floor. Sarah fell on her knees with a big grin on her face. She slowly lifted the yellow kitty and held its soft little body next to hers. 

Sarah gave the kitty a little kiss. Then she rubbed its head and neck. Soon it started making gentle sounds. "Why is the kitty making those funny sounds?" she asked her mother. "Oh, that's called purring. It's the sound kittens make when they're happy," her mother said. 

"Can I give it a name?" Sarah asked. 

"Sure. It's a girl kitty, but choose any name you like." her mother said. 

Sarah thought about it as her mother got two small bowls and placed them on the floor. Then she put water in one bowl and kitten food in the other bowl. "Okay, Sarah. Let's see if the kitty is hungry." 

Sarah put the kitty on the floor and it walked over to the food bowl. It quickly started to eat the food. 

Sarah laughed at the kitten and said, "I know. I'm going to name you Kitty." [Q:] what did the mother get Sarah? [A:] a kitty  [Q:] what color? [A:] yellow  [Q:] how old is sarah?

CHAPTER VI: A Game Of Hide And Seek 

There was a game of hide and seek that Danny Meadow Mouse once played with Buster Bear. It was a very dreadful game for Danny. But hard as it was for Danny, it didn't begin to be as hard as the game Lightfoot the Deer was playing with the hunter in the Green Forest. 

In the case of Buster Bear and Danny, the latter had simply to keep out of reach of Buster. As long as Buster didn't get his great paws on Danny, the latter was safe. Then, too, Danny is a very small person. He is so small that he can hide under two or three leaves. Wherever he is, he is pretty sure to find a hiding-place of some sort. His small size gives him advantages in a game of hide and seek. It certainly does. But Lightfoot the Deer is big. He is one of the largest of the people who live in the Green Forest. Being so big, it is not easy to hide. 

Moreover, a hunter with a terrible gun does not have to get close in order to kill. Lightfoot knew all this as he waited for the coming of the hunter of whom Sammy Jay had warned him. He had learned many lessons in the hunting season of the year before and he remembered every one of them. He knew that to forget even one of them might cost him his life. So, standing motionless behind a tangle of fallen trees, Lightfoot listened and watched.  [Q:] How many leaves does it take to conceal Danny? [A:] two or three  [Q:] What kind of animal was Danny? [A:] a Meadow Mouse  [Q:] What was his full name? [A:] Danny Meadow Mouse  [Q:] What was he playing? [A:] hide and seek  [Q:] With whom? [A:] Buster Bear  [Q:] lWas it easy for Danny?

[A:] a Deer  [Q:] Who else was ini that game? [A:] the hunter  [Q:] Where? [A:] in the Green Forest.  [Q:] What did Danny have to do to win? [A:] keep out of reach of Buster.  [Q:] What did Buster have to do to win? [A:] he had to his great paws on Danny,  [Q:] So what is Danny's advantage?' [A:] Wherever he is, he is pretty sure to find a hiding-place of some sort.  [Q:] Because of what? [A:] His small size  [Q:] Does Lightfoot have the same good point? [A:] no  [Q:] Why? [A:] he is big  [Q:] What does the hunter have? [A:] a terrible gun  [Q:] Who told Lightfoot about the hunter? [A:] Sammy Jay
Bath ( or ) is the largest city in the ceremonial county of Somerset, England, known for its Roman-built baths. In 2011, the population was 88,859. Bath is in the valley of the River Avon, west of London and south-east of Bristol. The city became a World Heritage Site in 1987. 

The city became a spa with the Latin name " ("the waters of Sulis")  AD 60 when the Romans built baths and a temple in the valley of the River Avon, although hot springs were known even before then. 

Bath Abbey was founded in the 7th century and became a religious centre; the building was rebuilt in the 12th and 16th centuries. In the 17th century, claims were made for the curative properties of water from the springs, and Bath became popular as a spa town in the Georgian era. Georgian architecture, crafted from Bath stone, includes the Royal Crescent, Circus, Pump Room, and Assembly Rooms where Beau Nash presided over the city's social life from 1705 until his death in 1761. Many of the streets and squares were laid out by John Wood, the Elder, and in the 18th century the city became fashionable and the population grew. Jane Austen lived in Bath in the early 19th century. Further building was undertaken in the 19th century and following the Bath Blitz in World War II. [Q:] What city hit 88,859 population in 2011? [A:] Bath  [Q:] What county is it in? [A:] Somerset, England,  [Q:] Is there a church there? [A:] yes  [Q:] What is it called? [A:] Bath Abbey  [Q:] And when was it established?

Lin Xiao, 21, a student at Guangdong University, has a big family - her two parents, a younger brother and two younger sisters. Lin took her role as the "big sister" seriously. When her first sister was born, Lin took turns with her mom holding the baby late into the night. "I almost did everything that was supposed to be a parent's job, but I felt proud of myself," she said. Not all of Lin's classmates shared her experiences because of the family planning policy , a law that was carried out in China about forty years ago. But the situation is about to change. A new policy made on October 29 said all couples can now have two children. The new policy is expected to help raise the population of China. Recently, China has been facing an aging population and labor shortages because of the low birth rate . The two-child policy may also be the gift for every only child. Researchers found that growing up with a brother or sister can have good influence on one's mental health. "Brothers and sisters do matter in unique ways. They give kids something that parents don't." Laura Walker, a professor from Beijing University, told China Daily. She noted that having a brother or a sister protects teenagers against loneliness, fear and so on. Liu Fang, 20, from Shenzhen University, has a 2-year-younger sister. When her sister disagreed with parents over choosing a college major, she helped her to communicate with parents. "If necessary, I would always have her back," said Liu. "The best part of having a sister is that you have a partner, friend and supporter throughout your life." But children with brothers or sisters also have to learn to understand and look after each other, said Laura. [Q:] According to the new policy, how many children are now allowed? [A:] two  [Q:] When was it enacted? [A:] October 29  [Q:] How far back was the original policy? [A:] about 40 years ago  [Q:] How many children were allowed then? [A:] one  [Q:] How old is Lin Xiao?

(CNN) -- It's a Friday in May, 2005, and Schapelle Corby stands in the center of packed courtroom on the tropical island of Bali, waiting to learn her fate. Will the beauty school student from Australia's Gold Coast be found guilty of smuggling a large bag of marijuana into Indonesia -- where the maximum penalty for drug trafficking is death by firing squad? 

A furrow forms between the 27-year-old's eyebrows as the judge reads out the verdict in Bahasa Indonesia. 

Corby appears confused. Her piercing blue eyes dart around the room -- at her family, at the cameras broadcasting live to televisions around Australia, at the ground, at her interpreter. Then reality sets in. 

Guilty -- the judge said. Her sentence? Twenty years in a Bali prison. 

At the back of the court, members of her family erupt with anger. 

"It's not alright! How dare you?" screams her sister, Mercedes. 

"We swore on the Bible to tell the truth and your fellow lied!" her mother, Rosleigh Rose, booms at the prosecutors. 

As her daughter is led away, Rose makes a promise: "Schapelle, you will come home. Our government will bring you home." 

Not since Lindy Chamberlain claimed a dingo took her baby in the Outback have Australians become so caught up in a courtroom drama. Nearly nine years on from the verdict, interest remains strong enough to sustain a soon-to-be-broadcast Australian telemovie based on the case. 

And now Corby has walked out of prison -- on parole but free. Yet Australia remains divided as to whether she is guilty of the crime.  [Q:] How old is the supect?

(CNN) -- The bodies of six men -- including a California educator -- were found Thursday in the north-central Mexican state of Durango, hours after they had been abducted from a nearby restaurant, the man's relatives said Friday. 

"He was needlessly and senselessly murdered," said Carlos Salcedo, 37, about his brother, Augustin Roberto "Bobby" Salcedo, of El Monte, east of Los Angeles. 

Bobby Salcedo, 33, had traveled with his wife to visit her family in Gomez Palacio, his brother said. They were eating in a restaurant Wednesday night when armed men barged in, forced everyone onto the floor and abducted all six men who were in the party, Carlos Salcedo told CNN in a telephone interview. 

At 7 a.m. Thursday, police notified his sister-in-law that they had found her husband's body in a local ravine with bullet wounds to the head and chest, he said. 

"All indications are that this was just random, a violent act, just a case of being in the wrong place at the wrong time," he told reporters in El Monte. 

"What we really want to do is just shed a light on this incident and the senseless, violent acts that are happening across the border from us and really just put a spotlight on this and make sure that we find justice." 

"He was a brilliant, a bright star for our community, and he as taken from us," said El Monte Mayor Andre Quintero of Salcedo, who served on the city school district board. "He was stolen from us and now we need to hold them accountable for what they did."  [Q:] Who was murdered? [A:] six men  [Q:] Were one of those men a teacher? [A:] Yes  [Q:] Where did this happen/ [A:] Durango  [Q:] Is that in Mexico? [A:] yes  [Q:] Where were they abducted from?

(CNN)Sri Lanka's current president Mahinda Rajapaksa has conceded defeat to rival Maithripala Sirisena in the country's presidential election, bringing an end to a decade of leadership increasingly criticized as corrupt and nepotistic. 

Rajapaksa acknowledged the defeat on his official Twitter account Friday, writing: "I value and respect our democratic process and the people's verdict, and look forward to the peaceful transition of power." 

Sirisena would be sworn in at 6 p.m. local time in Colombo's Independence Square, Dhanushka Ramanayake, the head of his media unit, said. 

The defeat of the once untouchable president, the longest-serving political leader in the region, was the result of a failed electoral gamble. 

In November, the 69-year-old called elections two years earlier than required, only to be shocked by the defection of many key political allies, including the man who would unseat him. 

The defections apparently wrong-footed Rajapaksa, and the opposition had the better of the campaign, say analysts. 

"He didn't expect the candidate to be Sirisena," said Paikiasothy Saravanamuttu, executive director of Sri Lanka's Center for Policy Alternatives. 

"I think he probably underestimated the disaffection in the country and the desire for change." 

Unexpected departure 

Sirisena, 63, served as general-secretary of Rajapaksa's Sri Lanka Freedom Party and health minister in his cabinet, before switching allegiance to a broad opposition alliance that proved to be the former president's most serious political challenge. 

The unwieldy coalition includes the center-right United National Party, the hardline Sinhala Buddhist Jathika Hela Urumaya as well as parties representing the substantial Tamil and Muslim minorities.  [Q:] When will Sirisena be sworn in? [A:] 6 p.m local time.  [Q:] Where? [A:] Colombo's Independence Square  [Q:] Where is that at? [A:] Sri Lanka  [Q:] Who did Sirisena beat in an election? [A:] Mahinda Rajapaksa  [Q:] What was his job? [A:] President.  [Q:] Of where? [A:] Sri Lanka  [Q:] How long did he hold the position? [A:] A decade.  [Q:] How does that rank in terms of serving? [A:] Longest-serving  [Q:] Why did he lose? [A:] Failed electoral gamble  [Q:] Did he want the election held earlier than usual? [A:] Yes  [Q:] How many years? [A:] Two years earlier.  [Q:] When did he enact this? [A:] November.  [Q:] Was he surprised about what happened? [A:] Yes  [Q:] How old was he when he made this decision? [A:] 69  [Q:] Does Sri Lanka have an executive director for policy alternatives? [A:] Yes  [Q:] What is their name? [A:] Paikiasothy Saravanamuttu  [Q:] Which party did Sirisena represent? [A:] Freedom Party  [Q:] Did he hold a cabinet position? [A:] Yes.  [Q:] Which one? [A:] health minister  [Q:] Did he switch to another party? [A:] Yes,
I shall never forget the night, a few years ago, when Marion J. Douglas was a student in one of my calsses. (I have not used his real name for personal reasons. As he requested.) But here is his real story as he told it before one of our adult - education classes. He told us how tragedy had struck at his home, not once, but twice. The first time he had lost his five-old daughter, a child he adored. He and his wife thought they couldn't bear that first loss; but, as he said:"Ten months later, God gave us another little girl and she died in five days." 

This double 

was almost too much to bear. "I couldn't take it," this father told us. "I couldn't sleep, I couldn't eat, I couldn't rest or relax. My nerves were entirely shaken and my confidence gone." At last he went to doctors; one recommended sleeping pills and another recommended a trip. He tried both, but neither helped. He said:"My body felt as if it was surrounded in a vice , and the jaws of the vice were being drawn tighter and tighter." The tension of grief ----if you have ever been paralyzed by sorrow, you know what he meant. 

But thank God, I had one child left ----a four --year-- old son. He gave me the solution to my problem. One afternoon as I sat around feeling sorry for myself, he asked; 'Daddy, will you build a boat for me?' I was in no mood to build a boat; in fact, I was in no mood to do anything. But my son is a persistent little fellow! I had to give in. 

Building that toy boat took me about three hours. By the time it was finished, I realized that those three hours spent building that boat were first hours of mental relaxation and peace that I had had in months! I realized that it is difficult to worry while you are busy doing something that requires planning and thinking. In my case, building the boat had knocked worry out of the ring. So I determined to keep busy. 

The following night, I went from room to room in the house, making a list of jobs that ought to be done. Scores of items needed to be repaired: bookcase, stair steps, storm windows, window-shades, locks, leaky taps. Amazing as it seems, in the course of two weeks I had made a list of 242 items that needed attention. 

"During the last two years I have completed most of them. I am busy now that I have no time for worry." 

No time for worry! That is exactly what Winston Churchill said when he was working eighteen hours a day at the height of the war. When he was asked if he worried about his huge responsibilities, he said :"I am too busy. I have no time for worry." [Q:] What was the father asked to build? [A:] a boat  [Q:] Who asked? [A:] his son  [Q:] Are there other children in the household? [A:] no  [Q:] What is his supposed name? [A:] Marion J. Douglas  [Q:] Did he loose a son? [A:] no  [Q:] A daughter?

[A:] yes  [Q:] What kind? [A:] sleeping pills
Once upon a time there was a bird named Lily. She lived in a tree with her parents. One day Lily flew to her friend Molly's tree nest, but she didn't ask for her parents' permission. They were having lots of fun playing that the time passed by so fast. They played tag. They played hide and seek. They even played racing to see who could fly the fastest. Lily's parents started to get very worried when she didn't return home for dinner. They called neighbors and friends, and even called Molly but they didn't hear the phone ringing. It wasn't until Molly's mom called her down to eat that Lily saw that it was almost past dinner time. Lily told Molly she had to go home. When Lily got home her parents were crying and very upset because they thought something happened to her. Lily felt very bad for not telling her parents, and she said she would never leave without telling them again. Her parents forgave her and sent her to bed. Lily went right to sleep. [Q:] Where did Lily go? [A:] Molly's  [Q:] Where did Lily live? [A:] tree nest  [Q:] How did the time pass? [A:] playing  [Q:] How many things did they play? [A:] three  [Q:] Who does Lily live with? [A:] her parents  [Q:] How did they feel? [A:] very upset  [Q:] When did they start to worry? [A:] when she didn't return home for dinner  [Q:] Who did they call? [A:] neighbors and friends,and Molly  [Q:] Did Molly answer? [A:] No  [Q:] What were her parents doing when she got home? [A:] crying  [Q:] Why?

One day Billy and Sandy went to the neighborhood fair. They were so exited because this year Bob the clown was going to be there. They had heard a lot about Bob the clown, he was funny and knew a lot of balloon tricks. He always made the kids laugh and gave out small prizes to many of the children at the fair. Billy and Sandy had even heard that sometimes Bob the clown would give out free cotton candy and candy apples. They had waited all year and were so excited. They did all their chores and cleaned their rooms so they could go to the fair. When they got to the fair they were so happy to see that Bob the clown was handing out cotton candy and candy apples. Billy and Sandy waited in line and then once it was their turn Billy got a balloon in the shape of a dog and Sandy got a big bag of cotton candy. They were both happy and could not wait to tell their friends all about Bob the clown. [Q:] How many people went to the fair? [A:] Two  [Q:] who? [A:] Billy and Sandy  [Q:] what fair? [A:] the one in the neighborhood  [Q:] who else was going to be there? [A:] Bob  [Q:] who was he? [A:] the clown  [Q:] was he funny? [A:] Yes  [Q:] what'd they do so they were allowed to go? [A:] Their chores  [Q:] did they clean their rooms too? [A:] Yes  [Q:] Was Bob there? [A:] Yes  [Q:] what was he doing? [A:] giving cotton candy  [Q:] anything else? [A:] candy apples  [Q:] Was there a line? [A:] yes
A couple of weeks ago, my 12-year-old daughter, Ella threatened to take my phone and break it. "At night you'll always have your phone out and break you'll just type," Ella says. "I'm ready to go to bed, and try to get you to read stories for me and you're just standing there reading your texts and texting other people," she adds. I came to realize that I was ignoring her as a father. 

Ella isn't the only kid who feels this way about her parent's relationship with devices. Catherine Steiner-Adair, a psychologist at Harvard, wrote The Big Disconnect: Protecting Childhood and Family Relationships in the Digital Age. For her book, Steiner-Adair interviewed more than 1,000 kids from the ages of 4 to 18. She talked to hundreds of teachers and parents. 

One of the many things that knocked my socks off, " she says, "was the consistency with which children -- whether they were 4 or 8 or 18 or 24-- talked about feeling exhausted and frustrated or mad trying to get their parents' attention, competing with computer screens or iPhone screens or any kind of technology." 

A couple of years ago, my daughter got a laptop for school. And because she was becoming more independent, we got her a phone. We set up rules for when she could use the device and when she'd need to put it away. We created a charging station, outside her bedroom, where she had to plug in these devices every night. Basically -- except for homework-- she has to put it all away when she comes home. 

Steiner-Adair says most adults don't set up similar limits in their own lives. "We've lost the boundaries that protect work and family life,'' she says. "So it is very hard to manage yourself and be present in the moments your children need you.'' 

After my daughter's little intervention ,I made myself a promise to create my own charging station. To plug my phone in-- somewhere faraway -- when I am done working for the day. I've been trying to leave it there untouched for most of the weekend [Q:] Who threatened to take a phone? [A:] Ella.  [Q:] What age is she? [A:] 12.  [Q:] Who works at a college? [A:] Catherine Steiner-Adair.  [Q:] What did her child receive for school? [A:] A laptop.  [Q:] What else? [A:] A phone.  [Q:] What did they make outside of her room? [A:] A charging station.  [Q:] She mentions a lot of grown ups don't make what in their lifetime? [A:] Limits.  [Q:] What does she vow to not touch during a day? [A:] Phone.  [Q:] What does she say her child CAN be active on her electronics? [A:] Homework.  [Q:] Besides weekdays - when else does she vow to not touch it very often? [A:] Most of the weekend.
CHAPTER XXIII 

A DINNER PARTY 

Phineas Duge in London was still a man of affairs. With a cigar in his mouth, and his hands behind his back, he was strolling about his handsomely furnished sitting-room at Claridge's, dictating to a secretary, while from an adjoining room came the faint click of a typewriter. Virginia entered somewhat unceremoniously, followed by Guy. Phineas Duge looked at them both in some surprise. 

"Uncle," she said, "I met Guy coming away from Coniston Mansions. He was looking for me, and I have brought him to see you." 

Phineas Duge held out his hand, and in obedience to a gesture, the secretary got up and left the room. 

"I am very glad to meet you, sir," he said. "By the by, my niece has only mentioned your first name." 

"I am the Duke of Mowbray," Guy said simply, "and I am very glad indeed to meet you if you are Virginia's uncle. I think that she treated me rather badly a week ago, but I am disposed," he added, with a twinkle in his eyes, "to be forgiving. I want your niece to be my wife, sir." 

"Indeed!" Mr. Duge answered a little drily. "I can't say that I am glad to hear it, as I have only just discovered her myself." 

"There is no reason, sir," Guy answered, "why you should lose her." 

"You don't even know my uncle's name yet," Virginia said, smiling. 

"I am Phineas Duge," Duge answered. "I dare say you have never heard of me. You see, I don't come often to England."  [Q:] what is Guy's title? [A:] Duke of Mowbray.  [Q:] Why is he glad to meet someone? [A:] Because he's Virginia's uncle.  [Q:] Who treated him badly? [A:] Virginia.  [Q:] he's disposed to be what? [A:] Forgiving.  [Q:] Does mr Duge smoke?

Education is the process of facilitating learning, or the acquisition of knowledge, skills, values, beliefs, and habits. Educational methods include storytelling, discussion, teaching, training, and directed research. Education frequently takes place under the guidance of educators, but learners may also educate themselves. Education can take place in formal or informal settings and any experience that has a formative effect on the way one thinks, feels, or acts may be considered educational. The methodology of teaching is called pedagogy. 

After the Fall of Rome, the Catholic Church became the sole preserver of literate scholarship in Western Europe. The church established cathedral schools in the Early Middle Ages as centers of advanced education. Some of these establishments ultimately evolved into medieval universities and forebears of many of Europe's modern universities. During the High Middle Ages, Chartres Cathedral operated the famous and influential Chartres Cathedral School. The medieval universities of Western Christendom were well-integrated across all of Western Europe, encouraged freedom of inquiry, and produced a great variety of fine scholars and natural philosophers, including Thomas Aquinas of the University of Naples, Robert Grosseteste of the University of Oxford, an early expositor of a systematic method of scientific experimentation, and Saint Albert the Great, a pioneer of biological field research. Founded in 1088, the University of Bologne is considered the first, and the oldest continually operating university. [Q:] What is considered the 1st and oldest university? [A:] University of Bologne,  [Q:] What year was it founded? [A:] 1088,  [Q:] After Rome fell, who was the only preserver of literate scholarship in Western Europe?

Arthur sat at the desk in his room, pencil in hand. He had to write a story for his English class by Friday. "! don't know what to write about, " he complained to his dog Toby, who was asleep at his feet. Arthur was talkative when speaking to his friends, yet he had trouble finding words when he had to write. 

By bedtime Arthur had drawn a picture of Toby smiling. He had drawn a tree with its branches blowing in the strong wind. He had also written a note asking his friend Lee to go to the movies on Saturday. But he had not written a single word of his story. 

On Wednesday, Mrs. Solomon, Arthur's English teacher, asked the class to turn in the first draft of their stories. His heart sinking, Arthur turned in the only work he had--the page with his name, the drawings and the note. 

Arthur wasn't surprised when Mrs. Solomon asked him to stay after class the next day. But he was surprised by what she said to him. " This is an attractive story, Arthur. The dog, the movie, the tree in the wind--I can't wait to find out how they all fit together. " 

"That isn't my story, Mrs. Solomon, " Arthur admitted. "I haven't been able to think of one yet. " 

"Oh, I think you have the seed of a story there, " Mrs. Solomon replied, "Look at your note and the pictures and see if a story comes to you. " 

That night Arthur sat at his desk, and this is what he wrote: "One Saturday Mike went downstairs to meet his friend Julio at the cinema. It looked as if it might rain, so Mike carried his umbrella. Suddenly a big storm blew in, bending the trees. The noise of the wind sounded like the barking of Mike's dog Toby. Toby really hated storms and barked whenever he wanted to be let inside. Then Mike realized that it wasn't the sound of the wind. It was Toby. The dog was running after him down the busy street, barking. The sound was filled with blame. Mike felt guilty because he had left Toby outside. He turned and headed home with Toby running beside him. Mike let Toby in the door just as the rain started to pour down. " 

Arthur had a story in the end. The last thing he did was to write his name proudly at the top of the page. [Q:] What was Arthur's school assignment? [A:] a story for his english class  [Q:] Who did Arthur complain to? [A:] his dog Toby  [Q:] What did Arthur draw a picture of?

[A:] the barking  of Mike's dog Toby  [Q:] In the story why did Mike feel guilty? [A:] Yes  [Q:] What happened right after Mike let Toby in the door? [A:] the rain started to pour  [Q:] Did Arthur have a story in the end? [A:] Yes
There once was a guy named Kevin and girl named Erin. They really liked spending time together. One day, Kevin traveled from his home in the United States of America to Erin's house in England. They then thought to take a sudden trip around the world. They first traveled by plane around Europe, where they saw many different people and sights. They then took a boat to Africa and Asia, where they went on a trip through the mountains. Later in the month, they traveled to China by train and were allowed to see how different life was over there. Next they took another plane to Australia, where they had a lot of fun seeing kangaroos and a different type of English speaking people. After spending a week in Australia, Kevin and Erin took a really long plane ride to North America, where they drove across the land. They saw everything from the mountains to forests. They even got to visit the beach! Because they had so much fun, Kevin returned home with Erin to England where they hung out and spent the next few days and months talking about all of the neat things they saw and did on their trip. [Q:] What was kevin's friend's name? [A:] Erin  [Q:] Where'd she live? [A:] in England  [Q:] Where'd they go first? [A:] around Europe  [Q:] how'd they get there?

An atoll (, , , , or ), sometimes called a coral atoll, is a ring-shaped coral reef including a coral rim that encircles a lagoon partially or completely. There may be coral islands/cays on the rim. The coral of the atoll often sits atop the rim of an extinct seamount or volcano which has eroded or subsided partially beneath the water. The lagoon forms over the volcanic crater or caldera while the higher rim remains above water or at shallow depths that permit the coral to grow and form the reefs. For the atoll to persist, continued erosion or subsidence must be at a rate slow enough to permit reef growth upwards and outwards to replace the lost height. 

The word "atoll" comes from the Dhivehi (an Indo-Aryan language spoken on the Maldive Islands) word "atholhu" (Dhivehi: , ), meaning an administrative subdivision. Its first recorded use in English was in 1625 as "atollon" – Charles Darwin recognized its indigenous origin and coined, in his "The Structure and Distribution of Coral Reefs", the definition of atolls as "circular groups of coral islets" that is synonymous with "lagoon-island". 

More modern definitions of "atoll" describe them as "annular reefs enclosing a lagoon in which there are no promontories other than reefs and islets composed of reef detritus" or "in an exclusively morphological sense, [as] a ring-shaped ribbon reef enclosing a lagoon". [Q:] what kind of coral reef is discussed? [A:] a coral atoll  [Q:] what shape is it? [A:] a ring  [Q:] what is another attribute? [A:] it encircles a lagoon  [Q:] where is the coral?

The Archbishop of Canterbury is the senior bishop and principal leader of the Church of England, the symbolic head of the worldwide Anglican Communion and the diocesan bishop of the Diocese of Canterbury. The current archbishop is Justin Welby. His enthronement took place at Canterbury Cathedral on 21 March 2013. Welby is the 105th in a line which goes back more than 1400 years to Augustine of Canterbury, the "Apostle to the English", sent from Rome in the year 597. Welby succeeded Rowan Williams. 

From the time of St Augustine of Canterbury in the 6th century, until Archbishop Reginald Pole in the 16th century, the Archbishops of Canterbury were in full communion with the See of Rome and they usually received the pallium. During the English Reformation, based upon King Henry VIII's divorce from Catherine of Aragon, the Church of England broke away from the authority of the Pope and the Roman Catholic Church. 

In the Middle Ages there was considerable variation in the methods of nomination of the Archbishop of Canterbury and other bishops. At various times the choice was made by the canons of Canterbury Cathedral, the Pope, or the King of England. Since the English Reformation, the Church of England has been more explicitly a state church and the choice is legally that of the Crown; today it is made by the Queen on the advice of the Prime Minister, who receives a shortlist of two names from an "ad hoc" committee called the Crown Nominations Commission. [Q:] Until when were the archbishops in full communion with the See of Rome? [A:] 16th century  [Q:] What did they usually receive? [A:] the pallium  [Q:] Who is the current archbishop?

CHAPTER XX 

WITH THE MAYOS 

The news that Terence brought to the regiment gave great and general satisfaction. Herrara was delighted to hear that he was to be made a lieutenant-colonel in his army. Bull and Macwitty were overjoyed on hearing that they had both been recommended for commissions, and Herrara's troopers were equally pleased. The rank and file felt no less gratification, both at the honour of being attached to the British army, and at the substantial improvement in their condition that this would entail. 

On the following day Herrara's friends and Mary O'Connor left for Lisbon, and the latter astonished Terence by bursting into tears as she said good-bye to him. 

"I have said nothing yet of the gratitude that I feel to you, Terence, for all that you have done for me, for you have always stopped me whenever I have tried to, but I shall always feel it, always; and shall think of you and love you dearly." 

"It has been just as fortunate for me as it has been good for you, Mary," he said. "I have never had a sister, and I seem to have found one now." 

The girl looked up, pouting. "I don't think," she said, "I should particularly care about being a sister; I think that I would rather remain a cousin." 

Terence looked surprised and a little hurt.

(CNN) -- World No. 1 Caroline Wozniacki began her latest bid for a first grand slam title with a 6-2 6-1 win over Anastasia Rodionova on Monday, joining last year's finalists Kim Clijsters and Li Na in the second round of the Australian Open. 

Top seed Wozniacki looked in good shape as she wrapped up victory against the Russia-born Australian in 76 minutes, but the Dane admitted she was worried about a wrist injury she suffered during last week's quarterfinal defeat at the Sydney International. 

"I was a bit nervous before the match. I didn't know exactly what to expect. But it feels better," the 21-year-old told the WTA Tour website. "I'm very happy about the way I felt out there today. I got into the rhythm as the match went on tonight." 

Who will be the 2012 Australian Open victors? 

Wozniacki will next play Georgia's 83rd-ranked Anna Tatishvili, who beat Australia's Ashleigh Barty 6-2 7-6 (7-4). 

Former No. 1 Clijsters made a strong start to the defense of her crown with a 7-5 6-1 defeat of Portuguese qualifier Maria Joao Koehler. 

The Belgian 11th seed, who will play France's world No. 98 Stephanie Foretz Gacon in the last 64, showed little sign of the hip injury which forced her out of the Brisbane International 10 days ago. 

"I wanted to go out there and I wanted to start playing," the 28-year-old told the tournament's official website. "I've had that ever since we came to Australia. 

"I had a good off-season where we worked obviously to try to be in good shape for Australia, then you want to put that to the test and play those matches again."  [Q:] What is Anna's rank?

Wool is the textile fiber obtained from sheep and other animals, including cashmere and mohair from goats, qiviut from muskoxen, angora from rabbits, and other types of wool from camelids. Wool mainly consists of protein together with a few percent lipids. In this regard it is chemically quite distinct from the more dominant textile, cotton, which is mainly cellulose. 

Wool is produced by follicles which are small cells located in the skin. These follicles are located in the upper layer of the skin called the epidermis and push down into the second skin layer called the dermis as the wool fibers grow. Follicles can be classed as either primary or secondary follicles. Primary follicles produce three types of fiber: kemp, medullated fibers and true wool fibers. Secondary follicles only produce true wool fibers. Medullated fibers share nearly identical characteristics to hair and are long but lack crimp and elasticity. Kemp fibers are very coarse and shed out. Wool's scaling and crimp make it easier to spin the fleece by helping the individual fibers attach to each other, so they stay together. Because of the crimp, wool fabrics have greater bulk than other textiles, and they hold air, which causes the fabric to retain heat. Wool has a high specific heat coefficient, so it impedes heat transfer in general. This effect has benefited desert peoples, as Bedouins and Tuaregs use wool clothes for insulation. [Q:] where are follicles located? [A:] In the skin.  [Q:] what layer? [A:] The upper layer.  [Q:] do follicles produce wool? [A:] Yes.  [Q:] does wool impede heat transfer? [A:] Yes.  [Q:] what desert people use wool? [A:] Bedouins.  [Q:] who else? [A:] Tuaregs.  [Q:] what is wool? [A:] The textile fiber obtained from sheep and other animals  [Q:] what is wool from goats called? [A:] Mohair.  [Q:] is wool chemically similar to cotton? [A:] No.  [Q:] what is cotton mainly made of? [A:] Cellulose.  [Q:] can you get wool from rabbits? [A:] Yes.  [Q:] what kind? [A:] Angora.  [Q:] how many types of fiber do primary follicles produce [A:] Three.  [Q:] what are they? [A:] Kemp, medullated fibers and true wool fibers.  [Q:] do secondary follicles produce three types as well? [A:] No.  [Q:] how many do they produce? [A:] One.  [Q:] which type? [A:] True wool fibers.  [Q:] is wool bulkier than other textiles? [A:] Yes.  [Q:] is it bad at retaining heat? [A:] No.  [Q:] what do the fibers hold? [A:] Air.
CHAPTER V. 

THE FITZGERALDS OF CASTLE RICHMOND. 

What idea of carrying out his plans may have been prevalent in Fitzgerald's mind when he was so defiant of the countess, it may be difficult to say. Probably he had no idea, but felt at the spur of the moment that it would be weak to yield. The consequence was, that when Lady Desmond left Hap House, he was obliged to consider himself as being at feud with the family. 

The young lord he did see once again during the holidays, and even entertained him at Hap House; but the earl's pride would not give way an inch. 

"Much as I like you, Owen, I cannot do anything but oppose it. It would be a bad match for my sister, and so you'd feel if you were in my place." And then Lord Desmond went back to Eton. 

After that they none of them met for many months. During this time life went on in a very triste manner at Desmond Court. Lady Desmond felt that she had done her duty by her daughter; but her tenderness to Clara was not increased by the fact that her foolish attachment had driven Fitzgerald from the place. As for Clara herself, she not only kept her word, but rigidly resolved to keep it. Twice she returned unopened, and without a word of notice, letters which Owen had caused to be conveyed to her hand. It was not that she had ceased to love him, but she had high ideas of truth and honour, and would not break her word. Perhaps she was sustained in her misery by the remembrance that heroines are always miserable.  [Q:] What is the chapter title?

BAGHDAD, Iraq (CNN) -- U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon paid a visit to Baghdad on Friday to congratulate its citizens for last weekend's "remarkable" Iraq-led provincial elections, a process he said "augurs well for the transition process and the solidifying of Iraq's national reconciliation." 

U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, left, meets Friday in Baghdad with Iraq President Jalal Talabani. 

On a tour that also has taken him to Pakistan and Afghanistan, Ban met with Iraqi leaders and appeared at a news conference with Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki, whose allies won big in nine of the 14 provinces where the local elections were held. 

"I have been following the electoral process closely from the early days of the parliamentary debate over the elections law last summer to the final stages of adjudication of the complaints and yesterday evening's release of the provisional results," Ban said at the news conference, according to prepared remarks issued by the United Nations. 

"It will be some days before final results are known, but current indications are that the elections have been successfully carried out." 

Ban last visited Iraq in 2007. In March of that year, he got a taste of the violence that often rocks the Iraqi capital. An explosion rattled Baghdad's International Zone, where he was holding a televised news conference with al-Maliki. 

Apparently used to such blasts, al-Maliki remained stoic, while Ban briefly ducked before regaining his composure and continuing. 

Now, he said, he's "very much impressed to have witnessed myself the great success and progress the Iraqi government and people have made under the leadership of Prime Minister Maliki, and I congratulate you," he said, emphasizing the improvements in security.

The day is like any other day in his life. Tom walks past the shop at the street corner. He stops to look at the front row of shoes, and he feels happy to see that pair of shoes he wants very much is still there. But he feels sorry for himself. He really wants to have them for his birthday. He sadly walks away and thinks how to tell his mother about it. He knows she will give him anything he likes if she can. He also knows very well that she has little money. He decides not to go home so quickly, because he looks worried and his mother will see it. So he goes to the park and sits on the grass. Then he sees a boy in a wheel chair. He notices that the boy moves the wheel chair with his hands. Tom looks at him carefully and is surprised to see the boy has no feet. He looks at his own feet. "It's much better to be without shoes than without feet," he thinks. He smiles and he is happier. [Q:] What special occasion is coming up?

Three high students become heroes after their act of saving a baby's life. 

Andrew Willis, 15, his brother Chris, 13, and friend Reece Galea, 14, were walking along Swallow Drive on their way to school on May 23, when Nicholle Price ran out of her house, shouting for help. Her six-month-old son Corey had swallowed an earring and the young mother couldn't ring for help because something was wrong with her phone. The three teenagers rushed to the aid of Ms Price, called an ambulance , calmed her down and waited with her until the ambulance arrived before heading to school. 

Ms Price, Corey and his grandmother Joyce Finnie visited the school last Thursday to thank the boys for their kind action. "It's good to know that there are still some good people who will stop and help," Ms Price said. "While I was shouting for help, a woman walking her dog went straight past, without stopping. I don't know what would have happened if these boys had not stopped." 

The teenagers were shocked at the attention they received at school for their heroic act but admitted that the incident was nerve-racking . "We heard her shouting so we knew something wasn't right," Andrew said. "We thought someone had died. It was scary but we just did what we had to do." 

Just as proud as the boys' parents is their principal, Tim McCallum. 

After two days in hospital, Corey has now fully recovered. "He's got two new teeth to show," Ms Price said. "I have to keep a closer eye on him. He's into everything now and grabs whatever he finds to put it straight into his mouth." [Q:] How many students became heroes? [A:] Three  [Q:] For what reason? [A:] For saving a baby's life.

Tommy was a cowboy. He and his horse, Candy, lived by the Gentle River. The Gentle River was as clear as a mirror. One day, Tommy was riding Candy along the shore when he saw a fire in the distance. 

"Wow," Tommy said. "I wonder why there's a fire." 

Tommy and Candy went to see. The fire was deep in the hills, and it took a long time to get there. By the time they arrived, it was almost supper time. 

The fire was a campfire. There was a little girl at the fire. She was drawing pictures with crayons. 

"Hello," Tommy said. "What are you doing in the hills?" 

"I'm Lucy," the girl said. "I'm camping, but my tent got blown away by the wind. So I'm sitting by the fire and drawing pictures." 

"What are you drawing?" 

"I'm finishing up this drawing of a dragon," she said. Then she pointed at two drawings on the ground next to her. They were held in place with pebbles. "This is an elf," she said. "And this is a pony." 

"They're very pretty," Tommy said. "I'm Tommy, and this is Candy." 

"Pleased to meet you," Lucy said. "Would you like to draw with me? We can do a drawing of Candy together." 

"That would be fun," Tommy said.

The Chicago Tribune is a daily newspaper based in Chicago, Illinois, United States, owned by Tronc, Inc., formerly Tribune Publishing. Founded in 1847, and formerly self-styled as the "World's Greatest Newspaper" (for which WGN radio and television are named), it remains the most-read daily newspaper of the Chicago metropolitan area and the Great Lakes region. It is the eighth-largest newspaper in the United States by circulation (and became the second-largest under Tribune's ownership after the "Chicago Tribune"s parent company purchased the "Los Angeles Times"). 

Traditionally published as a broadsheet, on January 13, 2009, the "Tribune" announced it would continue publishing as a broadsheet for home delivery, but would publish in tabloid format for newsstand, news box, and commuter station sales. This change, however, proved to be unpopular with readers and in August 2011, the "Tribune" discontinued the tabloid edition, returning to its traditional broadsheet edition through all distribution channels. 

The "Tribune"s masthead is notable for displaying the American flag, in reference to the paper's motto, "An American Paper for Americans." The motto is no longer displayed on the masthead, where it was placed below the flag. 

The "Tribune" was founded by James Kelly, John E. Wheeler, and Joseph K. C. Forrest, publishing the first edition on June 10, 1847. Numerous changes in ownership and editorship took place over the next eight years. Initially, the "Tribune" was not politically affiliated, but tended to support either the Whig or Free Soil parties against the Democrats in elections. By late 1853, it was frequently running xenophobic editorials that criticized foreigners and Roman Catholics. About this time it also became a strong proponent of temperance. However nativist its editorials may have been, it was not until February 10, 1855 that the "Tribune" formally affiliated itself with the nativist American or Know Nothing party, whose candidate Levi Boone was elected Mayor of Chicago the following month.

Around the World by Wheelchair 

Rick Hansen was always an active kid and loved to fish. When returning in a truck one day from a fishing trip, he had an accident and suffered injuries to his spine . This 15-year-old young man awoke to find that he had lost the use of his legs. However, he didn't give up. Many months later he began to compete in wheelchair sports. At the age of 27, he decided to wheel around the world to raise awareness and money for spinal cord research. His tour took him through 34 countries around the world between 1985 and 1987. In this Man of Motion World Tour, he wheeled 24,901.55 miles, which is equal to the distance around the earth. 

Bad weather and difficult, rocky roads often provided challenges for Rick, but he continued to push himself to complete the trip. He was determined to succeed. Even mountains did not stop Rick Hansen. He wheeled himself up the Rocky Mountains and several other major mountains in the world. He even wheeled himself along the Great Wall of China! 

"Never Give Up On Your Dreams" was his motto and he hasn't given up yet. He completed his world tour raising $24 million. He continues to work to increase knowledge of spinal cord injury.

There was a princess named Janet who was very pretty. She wanted to marry a prince named Harold, but Harold had three sisters that didn't want them to get married. Harold's three sisters were, Tammy, Jenny, and Clarice. Tammy and Jenny liked Janet, but Clarice didn't. Clarice was very mean to Janet, and tried to get Harold to hate the princess. One night, Clarice even threw a shoe at Janet. Janet ducked, and the shoe hit Harold instead. From that day on, Janet knew she would get even with Clarice. She was going to cut off her hair one night. While she was asleep she went into her room and did it with a scissors. When Clarice woke up she looked in the mirror and screamed. Then after that she didn't ever give the princess trouble, since she wanted her hair to be long. Then Janet was free to marry Harold and lived happily ever after in the castle.

The stated clauses of the Nazi-Soviet non-aggression pact were a guarantee of non-belligerence by each party towards the other, and a written commitment that neither party would ally itself to, or aid, an enemy of the other party. In addition to stipulations of non-aggression, the treaty included a secret protocol that divided territories of Romania, Poland, Lithuania, Latvia, Estonia, and Finland into German and Soviet "spheres of influence", anticipating potential "territorial and political rearrangements" of these countries. Thereafter, Germany invaded Poland on 1 September 1939. After the Soviet–Japanese ceasefire agreement took effect on 16 September, Stalin ordered his own invasion of Poland on 17 September. Part of southeastern (Karelia) and Salla region in Finland were annexed by the Soviet Union after the Winter War. This was followed by Soviet annexations of Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, and parts of Romania (Bessarabia, Northern Bukovina, and the Hertza region). Concern about ethnic Ukrainians and Belarusians had been proffered as justification for the Soviet invasion of Poland. Stalin's invasion of Bukovina in 1940 violated the pact, as it went beyond the Soviet sphere of influence agreed with the Axis. [Q:] When did Germany invade Poland?

(CNN) -- Justin Bieber's newest friend is Malala Yousafzai, the Pakistani schoolgirl who survived an attack by the Taliban and now advocates for girls' rights. 

Yousafzai has met with President Barack Obama, Queen Elizabeth II and many others, but her online encounter with Bieber on Wednesday is likely to make her the envy of teen girls around the world. 

Pakistan's Malala Yousafzai meets with Queen 

Bieber, 20, made sure his fans knew, posting a screenshot of his conversation with the 17-year-old activist on Twitter: "Just got to FaceTime with Malala Yousafzai. She has such an incredible story. I can't wait to meet her in person and talk about how I can support her and the @malalafund. #love" 

The Pakistani Taliban targeted Yousafzai for assassination in 2012 because of her outspoken support for girls' education in her native country. 

Yousafzai, who has not posted any tweets about her time with Bieber, did confide to CNN's Christiane Amanpour last year that she was a Bieber fan. 

Bieber's representative said she had "no official comment," including about if there are plans for the two to meet in person. 

The Bravest Girl in the World 

Despite Bieber's reputation as an out-of-control celebrity, earned partly from three arrests earlier this year, the pop idol has an impressive track record of good deeds. 

Bieber has helped grant the wishes of more than 200 children through the Make-A-Wish Foundation, which fulfills the wishes of children diagnosed with a life-threatening medical conditions.

Schleswig-Holstein is the northernmost of the 16 states of Germany, comprising most of the historical duchy of Holstein and the southern part of the former Duchy of Schleswig. Its capital city is Kiel; other notable cities are Lübeck and Flensburg. 

Also known in more dated English as Sleswick-Holsatia, the Danish name is "Slesvig-Holsten," the Low German name is "Sleswig-Holsteen," and the North Frisian name is "Slaswik-Holstiinj." Historically, the name can also refer to a larger region, containing both present-day Schleswig-Holstein and the former South Jutland County (Northern Schleswig) in Denmark. 

The term "Holstein" derives from Old Saxon "Holseta Land," ("Holz" and "Holt" mean wood in modern Standardised German and in literary English, respectively). Originally, it referred to the central of the three Saxon tribes north of the River Elbe: "Tedmarsgoi" (Dithmarschen), Holstein and "Sturmarii" (Stormarn). The area of the tribe of the Holsts was between the Stör River and Hamburg, and after Christianization, their main church was in Schenefeld. Saxon Holstein became a part of the Holy Roman Empire after Charlemagne's Saxon campaigns in the late eighth century. Since 811, the northern frontier of Holstein (and thus the Empire) was marked by the River Eider. 

The term Schleswig comes from the city of Schleswig. The name derives from the Schlei inlet in the east and "vik" meaning inlet in Old Norse or settlement in Old Saxon, and linguistically identical (cognate) with the "-wick" or "-wich" element in place-names in Britain.

The snow went on falling, and they could see only a few meters in front of them. "We should go back," said Judy.She was afraid. "But where is the path ?" Everything was covered with snow.The sky was grey."What's the time?" asked Paul.Judy looked at her watch."Nearly 5 o'clock.It gets dark in an hour." "We must start walking, and hope we find the path.I think the snow's stopping."said Paul.But it wasn't stopping.The wind was strong.It blew around them, cold and wet.

There once was a big black and white dog named Forrest. His owner's name was Jeff. Jeff thought he was the best dog in the whole world. 

One night, when Forrest and Jeff were taking a walk in the park, they saw two men walking down the path. Both men were dressed in very nice suits. 

Jeff waved at the men. 

"Good evening," he said. "How are you tonight?" 

"Hello," one of the men said. "It is such a great night for walking." 

Jeff and Forrest kept walking down the path. It was a very dark night, but the moon was shining bright. When Jeff turned around to look for the two men, he could not see them at all. They were nowhere to be seen. 

Later that night, when their walk was over, Jeff and Forrest were lying on the bed. They were watching a television show about ghosts. 

"Do you think maybe those two men were ghosts?" Jeff said out loud. "They did not leave a trace." 

Forrest was a dog, but he acted like he understood. He barked. 

Jeff smiled. He liked that his dog always saw things the same way he did. [Q:] Who is Forrest? [A:] dog  [Q:] and Jeff? [A:] His owner  [Q:] what did Jeff think of Forrest?

(CNN) -- A body discovered at Churchill Downs on Sunday, a day after the storied Louisville racetrack hosted the Kentucky Derby, may have been the victim of a homicide, police said. 

Workers in the barn area discovered the body early in the morning and notified track security, which called police, said Robert Biven, a spokesman for the Louisville Metropolitan Police Department. 

"We just got the call just prior to 5 a.m. to respond to the backside" of the racetrack, Biven told CNN. 

Police spokeswoman Alicia Smiley said police suspect foul play. 

The body, which has not been identified, appears to be a Latino man in his 30s or 40s, Biven said. 

About 400 people were located Saturday night in the rear of the racetrack, he said. "So we are trying to speak with as many people as we possibly can," he said. "We do have a few leads coming in." An autopsy is to be carried out Monday morning. 

Biven described the track's backside as "like a mini city," with 48 barns, workers' dormitories and areas where trainers live. "It's a 24-hour operation," he said. 

I'll Have Another wins Kentucky Derby 

Operations at the racetrack were to continue normally on Sunday, Churchill Downs spokesman John Asher said. No races are scheduled at the track for three days, but cleanup from Saturday's race was to continue and the racetrack museum was to be open, he said. 

CNN's Kara Devlin and Christine Sever contributed to this report

(CNN) -- It was in the majestic surroundings of Muirfield that the original gold-plated superstar of golf secured his first major title. 

The small town of Gullane to the east of Edinburgh that is all set to welcome the modern titans of the game for the 142nd staging of the British Open played host to a true pioneer back in 1896. 

Harry Vardon won a total of six British Open titles, a record that still stands, but his achievements in the game stretch far beyond his haul of majors, which was lifted to seven by his 1900 U.S. Open triumph. 

Not only was he credited with sparking an explosion of interest in the game during his tours of America at the turn of the 20th Century but he also devised the grip- -- "the overlapping grip" or the "Vardon overlap" -- that 90 percent of golfers still deploy. 

It is little wonder he is spoken of in such glowing terms by Australian Peter Thompson, who alongside American legend Tom Watson, is just one British Open triumph behind Vardon's half-dozen successes. 

"He was the God of golf," Thompson told CNN's Living Golf show. "To aspire to such a position was sacrilege -- it was way out of my league. 

"It wasn't until I passed five that I thought, 'Well, it's possible to equal the great man' but I didn't do it, regrettably. 

"It must have been inspirational to watch him swing. He had the power of a winning champion. Had someone won seven or even six Opens we wouldn't have had Vardon as a God.  [Q:] Who was the "god" [A:] Harry Vardon.  [Q:] Did he win the British open? [A:] Yes.  [Q:] How many times? [A:] Six  [Q:] Has anybody exceeded that? [A:] No.  [Q:] Which grip did he develop? [A:] " The overlapping grip"  [Q:] Does it have another name? [A:] Yes.  [Q:] By how many golfers? [A:] 90 percent.  [Q:] Where did he first win? [A:] Muirfield.  [Q:] Is that a poor area? [A:] No.  [Q:] Did he win any American tourneys? [A:] Yes.  [Q:] When? [A:] 1900  [Q:] Who is closing in on his record? [A:] Tom Watson  [Q:] And who else? [A:] Peter Thompson,  [Q:] How far away are they from the record? [A:] One British Open win.  [Q:] Are they French? [A:] No.  [Q:] Is anybody from the USA? [A:] Yes.  [Q:] Who? [A:] Tom Watson.

The Mongol Empire (Mongolian: "Mongolyn Ezent Güren" ; Mongolian Cyrillic: Монголын эзэнт гүрэн; ; also ("Horde") in Russian chronicles) existed during the 13th and 14th centuries and was the largest contiguous land empire in history. Originating in the steppes of Central Asia, the Mongol Empire eventually stretched from Eastern Europe to the Sea of Japan, extending northwards into Siberia, eastwards and southwards into the Indian subcontinent, Indochina, and the Iranian plateau, and westwards as far as the Levant. 

The Mongol Empire emerged from the unification of nomadic tribes in the Mongol homeland under the leadership of Genghis Khan, whom a council proclaimed ruler of all the Mongols in 1206. The empire grew rapidly under his rule and that of his descendants, who sent invasions in every direction. The vast transcontinental empire connected the east with the west with an enforced "Pax Mongolica", allowing the dissemination and exchange of trade, technologies, commodities, and ideologies across Eurasia. 

The empire began to split due to wars over succession, as the grandchildren of Genghis Khan disputed whether the royal line should follow from his son and initial heir Ögedei or from one of his other sons, such as Tolui, Chagatai, or Jochi. The Toluids prevailed after a bloody purge of Ögedeid and Chagataid factions, but disputes continued even among the descendants of Tolui. A key reason for the split was the dispute over whether the Mongol Empire would become a sedentary, cosmopolitan empire, or would stay true to their nomadic and steppe lifestyle. After Möngke Khan died (1259), rival kurultai councils simultaneously elected different successors, the brothers Ariq Böke and Kublai Khan, who then not only fought each other in the Toluid Civil War (1260–1264), but also dealt with challenges from descendants of other sons of Genghis. Kublai successfully took power, but civil war ensued as Kublai sought unsuccessfully to regain control of the Chagatayid and Ögedeid families. [Q:] When did Genghis Khan become ruler of Mongol? [A:] 1206  [Q:] Did his empire grow when he and his family ruled? [A:] Yes.  [Q:] What allowed trade with the east and west? [A:] Pax Mongolica  [Q:] How many sons did Khan have? [A:] at least 4  [Q:] Who was his original heir? [A:] Ögedei  [Q:] What were the grandchildren arguing over? [A:] If royal line should follow from his son and initial heir Ögedei, or another.  [Q:] What did their bickering cause to happen to the empire? [A:] civil war  [Q:] When was the Toluid Civil War? [A:] 1260–1264  [Q:] Did it involve family versus family? [A:] yes.  [Q:] Who won? [A:] Kublai  [Q:] Did it last, though? [A:] no
This year marks the 100thanniversary of Leo Tolstoy's death. He is considered by many to be one of the greatest novelists of all time. Much of the West is marking the anniversary with new translations of the author's works, including War and Peace. Movies are being released, including a black-and-white documentary and a feature film. In short, everyone is celebrating. Everyone, that is, except for people in Tolstoy's home country, Russia. 

The English newspaper the Guardian reports that the Russian government has scheduled nothing for November, the official anniversary of Tolstoy's death. The quiet is amazing, considering the importance of this man's contribution to global culture. 

"Across the whole world there is a huge Tolstoy boom ," Andrei Deryabin, co-producer of a new film about the author's final days titled The Last Station, told the Guardian. "He's esteemed everywhere apart from here in Russia." 

Experts explain the government's silence in various ways. Some refer to Tolstoy's disagreement with state-backed religion. Tolstoy's Christian views often _ those of the Roman Catholic church. 

His great grandson, Vladimir Ilyich Tolstoy, thinks Russia's cool attitude has more to do with history and the author's positive worldview. After all, the last century was a difficult one of the country's people. The darker writings of Fyodor Dostoevsky, he says, better fit the national character. Tolstoy hopes that as Russians grow more optimistic they will rediscover one of their own national treasures. 

"Tolstoy gives positive answers to the questions mankind is asking," he told the Guardian. " In this sense he gives more hope. I hope the 21stcentury is Tolstoyan."

"Everything happens for the best," my mother said whenever I was disappointed. "If you go on, one day something good will happen." When I graduated from college, I decided to try for a job in a radio station and then work hard to become a sports announcer . I took a taxi to Chicago and knocked on the door of every station, but I was t _ every time because I didn't have any working experience. Then, I went back home. My father said Montgomery Ward wanted a sports-man to help them. I applied , but I didn't get the job, either. I was very disappointed."Everything happens for the best," Mom reminded me. Dad let me drive his car to look for jobs. I tried WOC Radio in Davenport, Iowa. The program director, Peter MacArthur, told me they had already had an announcer. His words made me disappointed again. After leaving his office, I was waiting for the elevator when I heard MacArthur calling after me, "What did you say about sports? Do you know anything about football?" Then he asked me to broadcast an imaginary game. I did so and Peter told me that I would be broadcasting Saturday's game!

CHAPTER XXX 

FERN Mullins rushed into the house on a Saturday morning early in September and shrieked at Carol, "School starts next Tuesday. I've got to have one more spree before I'm arrested. Let's get up a picnic down the lake for this afternoon. Won't you come, Mrs. Kennicott, and the doctor? Cy Bogart wants to go--he's a brat but he's lively." 

"I don't think the doctor can go," sedately. "He said something about having to make a country call this afternoon. But I'd love to." 

"That's dandy! Who can we get?" 

"Mrs. Dyer might be chaperon. She's been so nice. And maybe Dave, if he could get away from the store." 

"How about Erik Valborg? I think he's got lots more style than these town boys. You like him all right, don't you?" 

So the picnic of Carol, Fern, Erik, Cy Bogart, and the Dyers was not only moral but inevitable. 

They drove to the birch grove on the south shore of Lake Minniemashie. Dave Dyer was his most clownish self. He yelped, jigged, wore Carol's hat, dropped an ant down Fern's back, and when they went swimming (the women modestly changing in the car with the side curtains up, the men undressing behind the bushes, constantly repeating, "Gee, hope we don't run into poison ivy"), Dave splashed water on them and dived to clutch his wife's ankle. He infected the others. Erik gave an imitation of the Greek dancers he had seen in vaudeville, and when they sat down to picnic supper spread on a lap-robe on the grass, Cy climbed a tree to throw acorns at them.  [Q:] what was being planned? [A:] a picnic  [Q:] who all was invited? [A:] Carol, Fern, Erik, Cy Bogart, and the Dyers  [Q:] what did Cy climb? [A:] a tree  [Q:] what did he throw from it?

A police force is a constituted body of persons empowered by the state to enforce the law, protect property, and limit civil disorder. Their powers include the legitimized use of force. The term is most commonly associated with police services of a sovereign state that are authorized to exercise the police power of that state within a defined legal or territorial area of responsibility. Police forces are often defined as being separate from military or other organizations involved in the defense of the state against foreign aggressors; however, gendarmerie are military units charged with civil policing. 

Law enforcement, however, constitutes only part of policing activity. Policing has included an array of activities in different situations, but the predominant ones are concerned with the preservation of order. In some societies, in the late 18th and early 19th centuries, these developed within the context of maintaining the class system and the protection of private property. Many police forces suffer from police corruption to a greater or lesser degree. The police force is usually a public sector service, meaning they are paid through taxes. [Q:] Is enforcing the law the entire goal of police? [A:] No  [Q:] What is their main activity concerned with? [A:] preservation of order  [Q:] In the 17-1800s, what was one other thing they were focused on? [A:] maintaining the class system  [Q:] Anything else? [A:] protection of private property  [Q:] Is it true that there has been corruption in the police department? [A:] Yes  [Q:] Just a few instances? [A:] No  [Q:] Is the force paid for privately? [A:] No  [Q:] How is it funded then? [A:] taxes  [Q:] What do they call an entity like that? [A:] public sector service  [Q:] Are all police forces paid that way? [A:] No  [Q:] Who gives them their power? [A:] the state  [Q:] How many main tasks are they asked to do? [A:] three  [Q:] Do they go to war? [A:] unknown  [Q:] Do they protect people's personal property? [A:] Yes
CHAPTER IX 

Ten days later, Harper and Joe Ladue arrived at Sixty Mile, and Daylight, still a trifle weak, but strong enough to obey the hunch that had come to him, traded a third interest in his Stewart town site for a third interest in theirs on the Klondike. 

They had faith in the Upper Country, and Harper left down-stream, with a raft-load of supplies, to start a small post at the mouth of the Klondike. 

"Why don't you tackle Indian River, Daylight?" Harper advised, at parting. "There's whole slathers of creeks and draws draining in up there, and somewhere gold just crying to be found. That's my hunch. There's a big strike coming, and Indian River ain't going to be a million miles away." 

"And the place is swarming with moose," Joe Ladue added. "Bob Henderson's up there somewhere, been there three years now, swearing something big is going to happen, living off'n straight moose and prospecting around like a crazy man." 

Daylight decided to go Indian River a flutter, as he expressed it; but Elijah could not be persuaded into accompanying him. Elijah's soul had been seared by famine, and he was obsessed by fear of repeating the experience. 

"I jest can't bear to separate from grub," he explained. "I know it's downright foolishness, but I jest can't help it. It's all I can do to tear myself away from the table when I know I'm full to bustin' and ain't got storage for another bite. I'm going back to Circle to camp by a cache until I get cured."  [Q:] Who advised Daylight about the number of moose? [A:] Joe Ladue  [Q:] Where was he talking about? [A:] Indian River  [Q:] Who was living there already? [A:] Bob Henderson  [Q:] What was he doing there? [A:] prospecting  [Q:] For how long? [A:] three years  [Q:] Are there many bodies of water there? [A:] yes  [Q:] Says who? [A:] Harper  [Q:] What does he think is going to happen? [A:] gold will be found  [Q:] Where did they put their trust? [A:] the Upper Country  [Q:] Where did Harper go? [A:] down-stream  [Q:] What did he take with him? [A:] supplies  [Q:] What was he going to open with them? [A:] a post  [Q:] Where? [A:] at the mouth of the Klondike  [Q:] Where did Daylight end up going? [A:] Indian River  [Q:] Who wouldn't go with him? [A:] Elijah  [Q:] What did he not want to have happen again? [A:] famine  [Q:] What did he say he couldn't leave behind? [A:] grub  [Q:] Did he not want to leave the dinner table even when he was stuffed? [A:] he didn't want to get up  [Q:] Where was he going to go? [A:] Circle  [Q:] Until what could happen? [A:] he is cured
If you live in the United States, you can't have a full-time job until you are 16 years old. At 14 or 15, you work part-time after school or on weekends, and during summer vacation you can work 40 hours each week. Does all that mean that if you are younger than 14, you can't make your own money? Of course not! Kids from 10-13 years of age can make money by doing lots of things. 

Valerie, 11, told us that she made money by cleaning up other people's yards. Lena, 13, makes money by knitting dog sweaters and selling them to her neighbors. Reisa said she had started taking art classes and showing her works to people. People ask her to draw pictures for them and they pay her for them. Jasmine, 13, writes articles for different magazines! 

Kids can learn lots of things from making money. By working to make your own money, you are learning the skills you will need in life. These skills can include things like how to get along with others, how to use technology and how to use your time wisely. Some people think that asking for money is a lot easier than making it; however, if you can make your own money, you don't have to depend on anyone else. The five dollars that you make will probably make you feel a lot better than the twenty dollars you ask for. [Q:] Kids can acquire new knowledge from making what? [A:] Money  [Q:] what is a new ability they can get from making that? [A:] How to get along with others  [Q:] anything else? [A:] How to use technology  [Q:] can the learn time management? [A:] Yes  [Q:] does creating their own income make the dependent on others? [A:] No  [Q:] what will make them feel the best? [A:] Making money instead of asking for it.  [Q:] how old do you have to be to work 40 hours? [A:] 14 or 15  [Q:] can they do that all year long at that age? [A:] No  [Q:] when is one time they can work that much? [A:] During summer vacation  [Q:] can kids not old enough to be employed by others earn money? [A:] Yes  [Q:] What does Jasmine do? [A:] She writes articles  [Q:] for who?

Dennis Rodman says he's not a diplomat, just a former NBA star fighting addiction and trying to be a better father. 

But that hasn't kept him from becoming embroiled, even if unintentionally, in U.S.-North Korea relations. 

His apparent chumminess with North Korea's leader has been controversial, as have previous proclamations that Kim Jong Un is a "nice guy." 

Rodman said he simply does not know enough about the allegations of abuse and authoritarianism that Kim is reviled for. 

"I keep telling people, I'm not there to be an ambassador to try to figure out why (is Kim) doing all these things? That's not my job," Rodman told CNN's Chris Cuomo on "New Day" Friday. 

It was his first interview since entering an alcohol rehabilitation facility two weeks ago. 

The former basketball player is probably the American with the most access to the North Korean leader, and many have been critical that he has not lobbied for the release of American prisoner Kenneth Bae from a labor camp. 

"I'm not an ambassador, and I tried to strive and tell people, just because I know the marshal (Kim), that doesn't mean I know the marshal like that," he said. 

Rodman says he didn't mean to insinuate during an earlier interview this month that he knew why Bae, a Korean-American, was being held in North Korea. 

"To this day I still don't know what he did," Rodman said, even offering to take Bae's place if he could. 

"I feel for (Bae's family). I feel for them deeply. ... I would do anything literally. This is Dennis Rodman talking.

Many of us use them several times a day without really noticing.And yet the way we in lifts,or elevators as they are known in the US,reveals a hidden anxiety. 

Passengers seem to know instinctively how to arrange themselves in an elevator,like the dots on a die.With each additional passenger, the bodies shift,going into the open spaces. 

On your own,you can do whatever you want--it's your own little box.If there are two of you,you take different corners, creating the greatest distance. When a third person enters, you will unconsciously form a triangle .And when there is a square, with someone I every corner.A fifth person is probable going to have to stand in the middle. 

Why are we so awkward in lifts? 

"You don't have enough space," says Professor Babette Renneberg, a clinical psychologist at the Free University of Berlin."Usually when we meet other people we have about an arm's length of distance between us. And that's not possible in most elevators, so it's a very unusual setting. It's unnatural." 

But perhaps there is more to it than just social awkwardness. 

"In the back of our minds we are a little anxious," says Nick White,an office in New York who was unfortunate enough to be trapped in a lift for41 hours. "We don't like to be locked into a place.We want to get out of the elevator as soon as possible, you know, it's a frightening place to be." 

During his terrible experience, he began to think of another encloses space-a tomb. 

Dr.Lee Gray agrees that a sense of disempowerment is the main cause of life anxiety. 

"You're in a machine that's moving, over which you have no control. You cannot see the elevator engine, you don't know how it's working," he says. [Q:] What is the primary device mentioned here? [A:] lifts,or elevators  [Q:] What can you do when you're in one alone? [A:] whatever you want  [Q:] Do two folks generally hang out close to each other? [A:] you take different corners  [Q:] What about three folks? [A:] you will unconsciously form a triangle  [Q:] And four? [A:] a square  [Q:] What happens to a 5th? [A:] stand in the middle  [Q:] Why is it weirder than in other social places? [A:] You don't have enough space  [Q:] According to whom? [A:] Babette Renneberg  [Q:] Are there any other reasons it's uncomfortable? [A:] we are a little anxious  [Q:] Who said that? [A:] Nick White  [Q:] What can one of these devices feel like? [A:] a tomb  [Q:] How controlling can you be in one? [A:] you have no control.  [Q:] Do you feel empowered? [A:] a sense of disempowerment  [Q:] Who makes this claim? [A:] Dr.Lee Gray  [Q:] How often to a lot of folks ride these devices? [A:] several times a day

CHAPTER XX THE FRIEND 



Less than half an hour later, Marguerite, buried in thoughts, sat inside her coach, which was bearing her swiftly to London. 

She had taken an affectionate farewell of little Suzanne, and seen the child safely started with her maid, and in her own coach, back to town. She had sent one courier with a respectful letter of excuse to His Royal Highness, begging for a postponement of the august visit on account of pressing and urgent business, and another on ahead to bespeak a fresh relay of horses at Faversham. 

Then she had changed her muslin frock for a dark traveling costume and mantle, had provided herself with money--which her husband's lavishness always placed fully at her disposal--and had started on her way. 

She did not attempt to delude herself with any vain and futile hopes; the safety of her brother Armand was to have been conditional on the imminent capture of the Scarlet Pimpernel. As Chauvelin had sent her back Armand's compromising letter, there was no doubt that he was quite satisfied in his own mind that Percy Blakeney was the man whose death he had sworn to bring about. 

No! there was no room for any fond delusions! Percy, the husband whom she loved with all the ardour which her admiration for his bravery had kindled, was in immediate, deadly peril, through her hand. She had betrayed him to his enemy--unwittingly 'tis true--but she HAD betrayed him, and if Chauvelin succeeded in trapping him, who so far was unaware of his danger, then his death would be at her door. His death! when with her very heart's blood, she would have defended him and given willingly her life for his.  [Q:] Where was Marguerite? [A:] inside her coach  [Q:] Where was she going? [A:] to London  [Q:] Who was she thinking of? [A:] Suzanne  [Q:] Did she care about her? [A:] yes  [Q:] Where was Suzanne? [A:] with her maid, and in her own coach  [Q:] Was she going to London too? [A:] no  [Q:] Where was she headed? [A:] back to town  [Q:] Was Marguerite married [A:] yes  [Q:] To who? [A:] Percy  [Q:] Did she love him? [A:] yes  [Q:] Was there anyone who hated Percy? [A:] yes  [Q:] Who? [A:] Chauvelin  [Q:] Did he want to hurt Percy? [A:] yes  [Q:] Did Marguerite feel blame for this? [A:] yes
CHAPTER XV. A DISOBEDIENT BROTHER 

Dan was his own man again in the morning, though rather pale and weak; he wanted to get up, but Cecily ordered him to stay in bed. Fortunately Felicity forgot to repeat the command, so Dan did stay in bed. Cecily carried his meals to him, and read a Henty book to him all her spare time. The Story Girl went up and told him wondrous tales; and Sara Ray brought him a pudding she had made herself. Sara's intentions were good, but the pudding-- well, Dan fed most of it to Paddy, who had curled himself up at the foot of the bed, giving the world assurance of a cat by his mellifluous purring. 

"Ain't he just a great old fellow?" said Dan. "He knows I'm kind of sick, just as well as a human. He never pays no attention to me when I'm well." 

Felix and Peter and I were required to help Uncle Roger in some carpentering work that day, and Felicity indulged in one of the house-cleaning orgies so dear to her soul; so that it was evening before we were all free to meet in the orchard and loll on the grasses of Uncle Stephen's Walk. In August it was a place of shady sweetness, fragrant with the odour of ripening apples, full of dear, delicate shadows. Through its openings we looked afar to the blue rims of the hills and over green, old, tranquil fields, lying the sunset glow. Overhead the lacing leaves made a green, murmurous roof. There was no such thing as hurry in the world, while we lingered there and talked of "cabbages and kings." A tale of the Story Girl's, wherein princes were thicker than blackberries, and queens as common as buttercups, led to our discussion of kings. We wondered what it would be like to be a king. Peter thought it would be fine, only kind of inconvenient, wearing a crown all the time.  [Q:] What did Sara Ray bring Dan? [A:] a pudding  [Q:] Were her intentions good? [A:] Yes  [Q:] How about the pudding? [A:] No  [Q:] Who got most of the pudding? [A:] Paddy  [Q:] What was Paddy? [A:] cat  [Q:] Where was he sitting?

(CNN) -- A body discovered at Churchill Downs on Sunday, a day after the storied Louisville racetrack hosted the Kentucky Derby, may have been the victim of a homicide, police said. 

Workers in the barn area discovered the body early in the morning and notified track security, which called police, said Robert Biven, a spokesman for the Louisville Metropolitan Police Department. 

"We just got the call just prior to 5 a.m. to respond to the backside" of the racetrack, Biven told CNN. 

Police spokeswoman Alicia Smiley said police suspect foul play. 

The body, which has not been identified, appears to be a Latino man in his 30s or 40s, Biven said. 

About 400 people were located Saturday night in the rear of the racetrack, he said. "So we are trying to speak with as many people as we possibly can," he said. "We do have a few leads coming in." An autopsy is to be carried out Monday morning. 

Biven described the track's backside as "like a mini city," with 48 barns, workers' dormitories and areas where trainers live. "It's a 24-hour operation," he said. 

I'll Have Another wins Kentucky Derby 

Operations at the racetrack were to continue normally on Sunday, Churchill Downs spokesman John Asher said. No races are scheduled at the track for three days, but cleanup from Saturday's race was to continue and the racetrack museum was to be open, he said. 

CNN's Kara Devlin and Christine Sever contributed to this report

The National Assembly for Wales (; commonly known as the Welsh Assembly) is a devolved assembly with power to make legislation in Wales. The Assembly comprises 60 members, who are known as Assembly Members, or AMs ("Aelodau y Cynulliad"). Since 2011, Members are elected for five-year terms under an additional members system, in which 40 AMs represent geographical constituencies elected by the plurality system, and 20 AMs represent five electoral regions using the d'Hondt method of proportional representation. 

The Assembly was created by the Government of Wales Act 1998, which followed a referendum in 1997. The Assembly had no powers to initiate primary legislation until limited law-making powers were gained through the Government of Wales Act 2006. Its primary law-making powers were enhanced following a Yes vote in the referendum on 3 March 2011, making it possible for it to legislate without having to consult the UK parliament or the Secretary of State for Wales in the 20 areas that are devolved. 

An appointed Council for Wales and Monmouthshire was established in 1949 to "ensure the government is adequately informed of the impact of government activities on the general life of the people of Wales". The council had 27 members nominated by local authorities in Wales, the University of Wales, National Eisteddfod Council and the Welsh Tourist Board. A post of Minister of Welsh Affairs was created in 1951 and the post of Secretary of State for Wales and the Welsh Office were established in 1964 leading to the abolition of the Council for Wales. The establishment of the Welsh Office effectively created the basis for the territorial governance of Wales. The Royal Commission on the Constitution (the Kilbrandon Commission) was set up in 1969 by Harold Wilson's Labour Government to investigate the possibility of devolution for Scotland and Wales. Its recommendations formed the basis of the 1974 White Paper "Democracy and Devolution: proposals for Scotland and Wales", which proposed the creation of a Welsh Assembly. However, voters rejected the proposals by a majority of four to one in a referendum held in 1979.

HAVE you noticed that the moon is becoming rounder and brighter day after day? That's because Sept 8 is the Mid-Autumn Festival. For Chinese people, a full moon means that family members can get together on that day. On the Mid-Autumn Festival, people get together and enjoy the round moon . They also send wishes for family members not with them. There are many stories about the moon to make the tradition more interesting. In China, Chang'e flying to the moon is a well-known legend . Hou Yi and Chang'e were husband and wife in old times. At the time, there were 10 suns in the sky. Hou yi, a brave man, shot down nine suns. People see Hou Yi as a great hero. Besides China, many other countries have beautiful stories about the moon. In Greek legend , Artemis is the goddess of the moon. She takes care of the hunt and wild animals. Artemis also looks after young children and women in childbirth . In India, the god of the moon is Soma. He has four hands and rides through the sky in a chariot . If a baby is born on a full moon day, Indian people believe he or she is lucky. [Q:] What's the date of the Mid-Autumn festival? [A:] Sept 8  [Q:] Does the moon wax or wane during this time?

The Kingdom of Yugoslavia (, , "Kingdom of South Slavia") was a state in Southeast Europe and Central Europe, that existed during the interwar period (1918–1939) and first half of World War II (1939–1943). 

It was formed in 1918 by the merger of the provisional State of Slovenes, Croats and Serbs (itself formed from territories of the former Austro-Hungarian Empire) with the formerly independent Kingdom of Serbia. The Kingdom of Montenegro had united with Serbia five days previously, while the regions of Kosovo, Vojvodina and Vardar Macedonia were parts of Serbia prior to the unification. 

For its first eleven years of existence, the Kingdom was officially called the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes, but the term "Yugoslavia" was its colloquial name from its origins. The official name of the state was changed to "Kingdom of Yugoslavia" by King Alexander I on 3 October 1929. 

The state was ruled by the Serbian dynasty of Karađorđević, which previously ruled the Kingdom of Serbia under Peter I from 1903 (after the May Overthrow) onwards. Peter I became the first king of Yugoslavia until his death in 1921. He was succeeded by his son Alexander I, who had been regent for his father. He was known as "Alexander the Unifier" and he renamed the kingdom "Yugoslavia" in 1929. He was assassinated in Marseille by Vlado Chernozemski, a member of the Internal Macedonian Revolutionary Organization (IMRO), during his visit to France in 1934. The crown passed to his then-still under-aged son Peter. His cousin Paul ruled as Prince regent until 1941, when Peter II would come of age. The royal family flew to London the same year, prior to the country being invaded by the Axis powers. [Q:] What is this about? [A:] Yugoslavia  [Q:] During which time period?

CHAPTER XXVII 

WAITING 

Ingleside, 1st November 1917 

"It is November--and the Glen is all grey and brown, except where the Lombardy poplars stand up here and there like great golden torches in the sombre landscape, although every other tree has shed its leaves. It has been very hard to keep our courage alight of late. The Caporetto disaster is a dreadful thing and not even Susan can extract much consolation out of the present state of affairs. The rest of us don't try. Gertrude keeps saying desperately, 'They must not get Venice--they must not get Venice,' as if by saying it often enough she can prevent them. But what is to prevent them from getting Venice I cannot see. Yet, as Susan fails not to point out, there was seemingly nothing to prevent them from getting to Paris in 1914, yet they did not get it, and she affirms they shall not get Venice either. Oh, how I hope and pray they will not--Venice the beautiful Queen of the Adriatic. Although I've never seen it I feel about it just as Byron did--I've always loved it--it has always been to me 'a fairy city of the heart.' Perhaps I caught my love of it from Walter, who worshipped it. It was always one of his dreams to see Venice. I remember we planned once--down in Rainbow Valley one evening just before the war broke out--that some time we would go together to see it and float in a gondola through its moonlit streets.  [Q:] Which literary giant wrote about Venice? [A:] Byron  [Q:] Did the the narrator ever visit the city? [A:] no  [Q:] But did he feel close to it? [A:] yes  [Q:] How did he describe it in his own words? [A:] "a fairy city of the heart"  [Q:] Who else was in love with the city? [A:] Walter  [Q:] Did he visit it? [A:] no  [Q:] Did he plan to visit it? [A:] yes  [Q:] With whom? [A:] the author  [Q:] Was there a specific place when they planned about it? [A:] yes  [Q:] Which place? [A:] Rainbow Valley  [Q:] When? [A:] just before the war broke out  [Q:] What they would wanted to see there? [A:] gondolas  [Q:] What disaster they were talking about? [A:] The Caporetto disaster  [Q:] Did they feel hopeless? [A:] no  [Q:] Was someone trying to conquer Venice? [A:] yes  [Q:] Were they successful yet? [A:] no  [Q:] How about Paris? [A:] no  [Q:] When it seemed they would conquer Paris? [A:] 1914  [Q:] What sea is by Venice? [A:] Adriatic  [Q:] What the city is called in reference to the sea? [A:] Queen of the Adriatic
CHAPTER II 

Serge went to Moscow. He entered the Teknik. He became a student. He learned geography from Stoj, the professor, astrography from Fudj, the assistant, together with giliodesy, orgastrophy and other native Russian studies. 

All day he worked. His industry was unflagging. His instructors were enthusiastic. "If he goes on like this," they said, "he will some day know something." 

"It is marvellous," said one. "If he continues thus, he will be a professor." 

"He is too young," said Stoj, shaking his head. "He has too much hair." 

"He sees too well," said Fudj. "Let him wait till his eyes are weaker." 

But all day as Serge worked he thought. And his thoughts were of Olga Ileyitch, the girl that he had seen with Kwartz, inspector of police. He wondered why she had killed Popoff, the inspector. He wondered if she was dead. There seemed no justice in it. 

One day he questioned his professor. 

"Is the law just?" he said. "Is it right to kill?" 

But Stoj shook his head, and would not answer. 

"Let us go on with our orgastrophy," he said. And he trembled so that the chalk shook in his hand. 

So Serge questioned no further, but he thought more deeply still. All the way from the Teknik to the house where he lodged he was thinking. As he climbed the stair to his attic room he was still thinking. 

The house in which Serge lived was the house of Madame Vasselitch. It was a tall dark house in a sombre street. There were no trees upon the street and no children played there. And opposite to the house of Madame Vasselitch was a building of stone, with windows barred, that was always silent. In it were no lights, and no one went in or out.  [Q:] How long did Sarge work? [A:] all day  [Q:] Were his teachers boring? [A:] no  [Q:] Were they hopeful for him? [A:] yes  [Q:] Where did Serge go? [A:] Moscow  [Q:] What did he go into? [A:] Teknik  [Q:] What was he?

[A:] he has too much hair  [Q:] What did Fudj say aout his vision? [A:] that he sees too well  [Q:] what did Serge do all day? [A:] he thought  [Q:] about whom? [A:] Olga Ileyitch  [Q:] who had she been with? [A:] Kwartz  [Q:] What is his job? [A:] he was the inspector of police  [Q:] Did she kill someone? [A:] yes  [Q:] who? [A:] Popoff  [Q:] What is his job? [A:] an inspector
(CNN) -- Kenyan actress Lupita Nyong'o has become a new critics' darling after her breakout role in last year's hit movie "12 Years A Slave." 

Since then, the award ceremonies and opportunities to dazzle photographers have been plentiful for Nyong'o, whose mesmerizing performance as Patsey earned her numerous accolades and recognition, including an Oscar nomination for Best Actress in a Supporting Role. 

Though all this attention is new to Nyong'o, who was born in Mexico to Kenyan parents, the young actress seems to enjoy all the hype around her. But there is much more to her story than how she captivates the cameras on the red carpet. 

CNN's Stephanie Elam caught up with Nyong'o to speak about her journey from Kenya to Hollywood. An edited version of the interview follows. 

CNN: How did you end up being born in Mexico? 

Lupita Nyong'o: My father is a politician. At the time he was also a professor of political science and he was organizing for democracy in Kenya. We were under an autocratic regime and after a series of unfortunate events, including the disappearance of his brother, he went into political exile in Mexico. I was born in his last year there.

Between 1836 and 1842 Victorian Aboriginal groups were largely dispossessed[by whom?] of their land. By January 1844, there were said to be 675 Aborigines resident in squalid camps in Melbourne. The British Colonial Office appointed five Aboriginal Protectors for the Aborigines of Victoria, in 1839, however their work was nullified by a land policy that favoured squatters to take possession of Aboriginal lands. By 1845, fewer than 240 wealthy Europeans held all the pastoral licences then issued in Victoria and became a powerful political and economic force in Victoria for generations to come.

(CNN) -- A Florida corrections officer assisting in a manhunt died Wednesday in an exchange of gunfire with a murder suspect, who also died, authorities said. 

Col. Greg Malloy, 44, was mortally wounded, the Florida Department of Corrections said in a statement. 

Malloy was working as part of the Holmes Correctional Institution's K-9 tracking team, which was assisting the Holmes County Sheriff's Office in the search for Wade Williams. 

Williams, wanted in the double homicide of his parents, was also killed during the exchange, according to the statement. The incident occurred about 13 miles from Bonifay in the Florida Panhandle. 

"Words can never express our emotions when an officer falls in the line of duty," said Department of Corrections Secretary Walt McNeil. "Tragedies such as today's underscore the dangers inherent in our profession, both inside and outside the prison walls. We extend our condolences to Greg's family and his co-workers." 

Malloy began his career with the Department of Corrections in 1988. 

The Florida Department of Law Enforcement is conducting the shooting investigation. The Holmes County sheriff had not yet responded to a message left by CNN Wednesday afternoon.

Aragon ( or , Spanish and , or ) is an autonomous community in Spain, coextensive with the medieval Kingdom of Aragon. Located in northeastern Spain, the Aragonese autonomous community comprises three provinces (from north to south): Huesca, Zaragoza, and Teruel. Its capital is Zaragoza (also called "Saragossa" in English). The current Statute of Autonomy declares Aragon a "nationality" of Spain. 

Aragon's northern province of Huesca borders France and is positioned in the middle of the Pyrenees. Within Spain, the community is flanked by Catalonia to the east, Valencian Community and Castilla–La Mancha to the south, and Castile and León, La Rioja, and Navarre to the west. 

Covering an area of , the region's terrain ranges diversely from permanent glaciers to verdant valleys, rich pasture lands and orchards, through to the arid steppe plains of the central lowlands. Aragon is home to many rivers—most notably, the river Ebro, Spain's largest river in volume, which runs west-east across the entire region through the province of Zaragoza. It is also home to the Aneto, the highest mountain in the Pyrenees. 

, the population of Aragon was 1,317,847, with slightly more than half of it living in Zaragoza, its capital city. The economy of Aragon generates () a GDP of €33,162 million which represents 3.13% of Spain's national GDP, and is currently 6th in per capita production behind Madrid, Basque Country, Navarre, Catalonia and La Rioja.

It was a cold winter day. A woman drove up to the Rainbow Bridge tollbooth . "I'm paying for myself, and for the six cars behind me," she said with a smile, handing over seven tickets. One after another, the next six drivers arriving at the tollbooth were informed, "Some lady up ahead already paid your fare." 

It turned out that the woman, Natalie Smith, had read something on a friend's refrigerator: "Practice random kindness and senseless acts of beauty." The phrase impressed her so much that she copied it down. 

Judy Foreman spotted the same phrase on a warehouse wall far away from home. When it stayed on her mind for days, she gave up and drove all the way back to copy it down. "I thought it was beautiful," she said, explaining why she'd taken to writing it at the bottom of all her letters, "like a message from above." Her husband, Frank, liked the phrase so much that he put it up on the classroom wall for his students, one of whom was the daughter of Alice Johnson, a local news reporter. Alice put it in the newspaper, admitting that though she liked it, she didn't know where it came from or what it really meant. 

Two days later, Alice got a call from Anne Herbert, a woman living in Marin. It was in a restaurant that Anne wrote the phrase down on a piece of paper, after turning it around in her mind for days. 

"Here's the idea," Anne says. "Anything you think there should be more of, do it randomly." Her fantasies include painting the classrooms of shabby schools, leaving hot meals on kitchen tables in the poor part of town, and giving money secretly to a proud old lady. Anne says, " _ ." 

The acts of random kindness spread. If you were one of those drivers who found your fare paid, who knows what you might have been inspired to do for someone else later. Like all great events, kindness begins slowly, with every single act. Let it be yours! [Q:] How many cars did the woman pay for? [A:] Seven  [Q:] where at? [A:] Rainbow Bridge tollbooth  [Q:] what were the other drivers told? [A:] Some lady up ahead already paid your fare  [Q:] who was the lady?

Mao Zedong or Mao Tse-tung (; December 26, 1893September 9, 1976), also known as Chairman Mao, was a Chinese communist revolutionary, poet, political theorist and founding father of the People's Republic of China, which he governed as the Chairman of the Communist Party of China from its establishment in 1949 until his death in 1976. His Marxist–Leninist theories, military strategies and political policies are collectively known as Maoism or Marxism–Leninism–Maoism. 

Born the son of a wealthy farmer in Shaoshan, Hunan, Mao adopted a Chinese nationalist and anti-imperialist outlook in early life, particularly influenced by the events of the Xinhai Revolution of 1911 and May Fourth Movement of 1919. Mao adopted Marxism–Leninism while working at Peking University and became a founding member of the Communist Party of China (CPC), leading the Autumn Harvest Uprising in 1927. During the Chinese Civil War between the Kuomintang (KMT) and the CPC, Mao helped to found the Chinese Workers' and Peasants' Red Army, led the Jiangxi Soviet's radical land policies and ultimately became head of the CPC during the Long March. Although the CPC temporarily allied with the KMT under the United Front during the Second Sino-Japanese War (1937–1945), after Japan's defeat China's civil war resumed and in 1949 Mao's forces defeated the Nationalists who withdrew to Taiwan.

(CNN) -- The Supreme Court has just agreed to take on the case of Fisher v. University of Texas. Abigail Fisher, a white woman, argues that she has been a victim of the university's race-conscious admission policies; the university contends that its drive for racial and ethnic diversity is educationally enriching -- a benefit to all students. 

Will the ugly discourse that generally characterizes debate over racially preferential policies disappear with the wave of a magic Supreme Court wand? It seems unlikely. The issue is a cat with many more than nine lives. It arrived in the early 1970s and, despite many attacks, some of which have taken the form of amendments to state constitutions, it has survived in pretty fine fettle. 

The court will have only eight justices to hear the arguments. Elena Kagan, having been involved in the case as solicitor general in the Obama administration, has bowed out of participation. Her absence, however, leaves five justices likely to express at least some degree of skepticism about the racial preferences given to non-Asian minorities in the admissions process. 

Has the University of Texas been enriched by academic diversity? Maybe. But equally likely is the possibility that racial double standards reinforce stereotypes about smart whites and even smarter Asians. There are certainly wide gaps in the average SAT scores between blacks and Hispanics, on the one hand, and whites and Asians, on the other hand. 

Among freshmen entering the University of Texas in 2009 who did not fall into the top 10% of their high school class (automatic admission at the university), Asians scored at the 93rd percentile of 2009 SAT takers nationwide, whites at the 89th percentile, Hispanics at the 80th percentile and blacks at the 52nd percentile. Startling? No. This picture has been well known for a long time. Heartbreaking, yes, because the numbers mean the underperforming minority students are being woefully ill served by the K-12 school system. Moreover, arriving at institutions of higher education with an academic disadvantage, they do not catch up, as it has become clear.  [Q:] What does being in the top 10% of your high school class get you? [A:] automatic admission  [Q:] To where? [A:] at the university  [Q:] Which one? [A:] University of Texas  [Q:] Where do whites rank on the SAT? [A:] 89th percentile  [Q:] Asians? [A:] 93rd percentile  [Q:] Hispanics [A:] 80th percentile  [Q:] Blacks?

Anna loved the beach and went as often as she could. She liked the birds and the waves. Jason did not like the beach. He did not like how warm the sand was. He didn't like the salt in the water. Jason wanted to stay home. Jason went to the beach with his mother and father and met Anna. She had a red kite that Jason liked very much. Anna was having trouble getting the kite in the air and was sad. Jason went over to help her and together they got the kite into the air and watched it go higher and higher. Anna let Jason fly the kite for a little bit. After that Jason was hungry. Anna showed him that she had brought a green Picnic basket from her house. Inside the picnic basket there were cakes and sandwiches and salad and some fruit. Jason had brought lemonade in a blue bottle and shared it with Anna. It was the most fun Jason had at the beach.

CHAPTER XXIII 

LOVERS 

Bernard Maddison kept his engagement that evening, and dined alone with Lady Thurwell and Helen. There had been some talk of going to the opera afterwards, but no one seemed to care about it, and so it dropped through. 

"For my part," Lady Thurwell said, as they sat lingering over their dessert, "I shall quite enjoy an evening's rest. You literary men, Mr. Maddison, talk a good deal about being overworked, but you know nothing of the life of a chaperon in the season. I tell Helen that she is sadly wanting in gratitude. We do everything worth doing--picture galleries, matinées, shopping, afternoon calls, dinners, dances, receptions--why, there's no slavery like it." 

Helen laughed softly. 

"We do a great deal too much, aunt," she said. "I am almost coming round to my father's opinion. You know, Mr. Maddison, he very seldom comes to London, and then only when he wants to pay a visit to his gunmaker, or to renew his hunting kit, or something of that sort. London life does not suit him at all." 

"I think your father a very wise man," he answered. "He seeks his pleasures in a more wholesome manner." 

She looked thoughtful. 

"Yes, I suppose, ethically, the life of a man about town is on a very low level. That is why one meets so few who interest one, as a rule. Don't you think all this society life very frivolous, Mr. Maddison?" 

"I am not willing to be its judge," he answered. "Yet it is a moral axiom that the higher we seek for our pleasures the greater happiness we attain to. I am an uncompromising enemy to what is known as fashionable society, so I will draw no conclusions."  [Q:] Who does city life not favor? [A:] Helen's father  [Q:] Does he visit there often? [A:] no  [Q:] Why does he come then? [A:] when he wants to pay a visit to his gunmaker  [Q:] Any other reason? [A:] or to renew his hunting kit  [Q:] Who thinks that's a smart move? [A:] Mr. Maddison  [Q:] Why's that? [A:] He seeks his pleasures in a more wholesome manner  [Q:] Did she immediately dismiss the thought? [A:] no  [Q:] How many interesting people does she feel one tends to meet? [A:] few  [Q:] Does Maddison find it all shallow? [A:] he draws no conclusions  [Q:] Is he a fan then? [A:] unknown  [Q:] How many people are eating together? [A:] Three  [Q:] What are their names? [A:] Bernard Maddison, Lady Thurwell, and Helen  [Q:] Are they heading out to a performance soon? [A:] no  [Q:] What part of the meal are they on? [A:] dessert  [Q:] What kind of a man is he? [A:] a literary man  [Q:] Is Thurwell looking forward to an active night? [A:] no  [Q:] In what capacity is she acting for the dinner? [A:] chaperon  [Q:] For whom? [A:] Helen  [Q:] Is Helen grateful? [A:] no  [Q:] What kind of things do they do together?

A little boy named Jimmy and his best friend Jeremy are walking home from school one day in the cold. They walk and talk about how different kindergarten is from the first grade. Jimmy and Jeremy are in different classes and they do different things. Jimmy's teacher has the kids do lots of arts and crafts making sock puppets, pasting pictures and many other things. Jeremy wishes he was in the same class as Jimmy because they are best friends and he likes doing arts and crafts. Jimmy tells Jeremy that they are going to be best friends even if they are in different classes, this makes Jeremy feel better. Jimmy remembers that Jeremy's birthday party is next week and he gets excited. Jimmy has the idea to make Jeremy a birthday cake with the help of his mother. They finally arrive at the corner where Jimmy lives and they promise to meet up the next morning for the walk to school. Jeremy lives three houses down and he races home.

(CNN) -- With a fourth video released, Gruber-gate is now in full swing. 

The latest caught-on-tape remarks from economist Jonathan Gruber, one of the architects of the Affordable Care Act, has him asserting back in 2010 that the "American public" -- that's you and me -- "doesn't actually care that much about the uninsured." He thinks he knows us so well. 

In another video released earlier, he said that to pass new health care legislation, the Obama administration successfully relied on an electorate -- again, you and me -- that didn't really understand it. 

"It's a very clever, you know, basic exploitation of the lack of economic understanding of the American voter," he tells the Honors Colloquium 2012 at the University of Rhode Island. 

There appears to be a bottomless well of Gruber's greatest hits. 

In yet another, from a speech at the University of Pennsylvania in 2013, he explains that the very function of the law -- doing what it was designed to do -- was totally unpalatable to voters (that is, if only we'd turned away from our Cheetos bags and NASCAR races long enough to catch it). 

"If you had a law which said healthy people are going to pay in -- if you made it explicit that healthy people pay in and sick people get money, it would not have passed." 

To hammer the point home, he admits that the sales pitch was one big cover-up operation: "Lack of transparency is a huge advantage. And basically, you know, call it the stupidity of the American voter or whatever. But basically that was really, really critical to getting the thing to pass."  [Q:] what happened in 2013 ?

CHAPTER IV. 

Lady Wallinger and Edith were together in the morning room of Hellingsley, the morrow after the arrival of Oswald. Edith was arranging flowers in a vase, while her aunt was embroidering a Spanish peasant in correct costume. The daughter of Millbank looked as bright and fragrant as the fair creations that surrounded her. Beautiful to watch her as she arranged their forms and composed their groups; to mark her eye glance with gratification at some happy combination of colour, or to listen to her delight as they wafted to her in gratitude their perfume. Oswald and Sir Joseph were surveying the stables; Mr. Millbank, who had been daily expected for the last week from the factories, had not yet arrived. 

'I must say he gained my heart from the first,' said Lady Wallinger. 

'I wish the gardener would send us more roses,' said Edith. 

'He is so very superior to any young man I ever met,' continued Lady Wallinger. 

'I think we must have this vase entirely of roses; don't you think so, aunt?' inquired her niece. 

'I am fond of roses,' said Lady Wallinger. 'What beautiful bouquets Mr. Coningsby gave us at Paris, Edith!' 

'Beautiful!' 

'I must say, I was very happy when I met Mr. Coningsby again at Cambridge,' said Lady Wallinger. 'It gave me much greater pleasure than seeing any of the colleges.' 

'How delighted Oswald seems at having Mr. Coningsby for a companion again!' said Edith. 

'And very naturally,' said Lady Wallinger. 'Oswald ought to deem himself fortunate in having such a friend. I am sure the kindness of Mr. Coningsby when we met him at Cambridge is what I never shall forget. But he always was my favourite from the first time I saw him at Paris. Do you know, Edith, I liked him best of all your admirers.'  [Q:] Was someone in the morning room alone? [A:] no  [Q:] Who was there? [A:] Lady Wallinger and Edith  [Q:] When? [A:] the morrow after the arrival of Oswald  [Q:] What was Edith doing? [A:] arranging flowers  [Q:] And the other woman? [A:] embroidering  [Q:] What was she embroidering? [A:] a Spanish peasant in correct costume  [Q:] Where was Oswald? [A:] the stables  [Q:] Was he alone? [A:] no  [Q:] Who was with him? [A:] Sir Joseph  [Q:] What were the two doing? [A:] surveying the stables  [Q:] Who had yet to arrive? [A:] Mr. Millbank  [Q:] Where was he supposed to arrive from? [A:] the factories  [Q:] What did Edith want? [A:] more roses  [Q:] From whom? [A:] the gardener  [Q:] Did Lady Wallinger describe him as substandard? [A:] no  [Q:] Did her niece want other flowers in the vase? [A:] no  [Q:] What city had they gotten them at before?

PITTSBURGH - For most people, snakes seem unpleasant or even threatening. But Howie Choset sees in their delicate movements a way to save lives. 

The 37-year-old Carnegie Mellon University professor has spent years developing snake-like robots he hopes will eventually slide through fallen buildings in search of victims trapped after natural disasters or other emergencies. 

Dan Kara is president of Robotics Trends, a Northboro, Mass.-based company that publishes an online industry magazine and runs robotics trade shows. He said there are other snake-like robots being developed, mainly at universities, but didn't know of one that could climb pipes. 

The Carnegie Mellon machines are designed to carry cameras and electronic sensors and can be controlled with a joystick . They move smoothly with the help of small electric motors, or servos, commonly used by hobbyists in model airplanes. 

Built from lightweight materials, the robots are about the size of a human arm or smaller. They can sense which way is up, but are only as good as their human operators, Choset added. 

Sam Stover, a search term manager with the Federal Emergency Management Agency based in Indiana, said snake-type robots would offer greater mobility than equipment currently available, such as cameras attached to extendable roles. 

"It just allows us to do something we've not been able to do before," Stover said, "We needed them yesterday." 

He said snifter dogs are still the best search tool for rescue workers, but that they can only be used effectively when workers have access to damaged building. 

Stover, among the rescue workers who handled the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina, said snake robots would have helped rescuers search flooded houses in that disaster. 

Choset said the robots may not be ready for use for another five to ten years, depending on funding. [Q:] Who uses snakes to save lives? [A:] Howie Choset  [Q:] How old is he?

There once was a boy named John who was a good superhero. He thought he was a superhero, at least. His mommy made him eat his cereal with yoghurt every morning so he could stay strong. Today he had to go to school and he wasn't very happy about that. After breakfast he walked to the bus stop. There he found his neighbor Ashley, who was also an evil superhero. John thought she was an evil superhero at least. When John got to the bus stop, Ashley made a silly face at him. Then she dared him to lick a worm she found on the sidewalk. John had super powers, so he said yes to the dare. He picked up the worm. It was slimy and gross. It wiggled around between his fingers. John closed his eyes and licked it. Ashley laughed so hard, she fell to the ground. But John felt like a real superhero who had won the day for good kids everywhere. First thing tomorrow, John would start wearing a cape to school. He hoped his mommy would let him wear it. The bus came and Ashley was still sitting on the ground laughing. John had a great, superhero kind of thought. He put the worm in her hair. Now Ashley was screaming! John the superhero got in trouble for that. [Q:] What was the child's name? [A:] John  [Q:] WHat was he? [A:] a good superhero  [Q:] WHat did he eat for breakfast? [A:] cereal with yoghurt  [Q:] Why was he unhappy? [A:] he had to go to school  [Q:] Who did he see at the bus stop? [A:] his neighbor Ashley  [Q:] WHat did she do first? [A:] made a silly face at him  [Q:] And then? [A:] she dared him to lick a worm she found on the sidewalk  [Q:] Did he do it? [A:] yes  [Q:] Why? [A:] because he had super powers  [Q:] What did he decide to do on the next day? [A:] wear a cape  [Q:] Whose permission did he need? [A:] his mommy  [Q:] WHat did John do to Ashley? [A:] put the worm in her hair  [Q:] WHat did she do then? [A:] scream  [Q:] How often did he have breakfast? [A:] every morning
Tom goes everywhere with Catherine Green, a 54-year-old secretary. He moves around her office at work and goes shopping with her. "Most people don't seem to mind Tom," says Catherine, who thinks he is wonderful. "He's my fourth child," she says. She may think of him and treat him that way as her son. He moves around buying his food, paying his health bills and his taxes, but in fact Tom is a dog. 

Catherine and Tom live in Sweden, a country where everyone is expected to lead an orderly life according to rules laid down by the government, which also provides a high level of care for its people. This level of care costs money. 

People in Sweden pay taxes on everything, so aren't surprised to find that owning a dog means more taxes. Some people are paying as much as 500 Swedish kronor in taxes a year for the right to keep their dog, which is spent by the government on dog hospitals and sometimes medical treatment for a dog that falls ill. However, most such treatment is expensive, so owners often decide to offer health and even life _ for their dog. 

In Sweden dog owners must pay for any damage their dog does. A Swedish Kennel Club official explains what this means: if your dog runs out on the road and gets hit by a passing car, you, as the owner, have to pay for any damage done to the car, even if your dog has been killed in the accident. [Q:] How old is Catherine? [A:] 54  [Q:] where does she live? [A:] Sweden  [Q:] Who is Tom? [A:] a dog  [Q:] Who provides care for its people? [A:] the government  [Q:] is it expensive? [A:] Yes  [Q:] How do they afford it? [A:] owners offer health and even life _ for their dog.  [Q:] Are there taxes on most things in Sweden? [A:] Yes  [Q:] even dogs? [A:] Yes  [Q:] how much? [A:] 500 Swedish kronor  [Q:] what is that money used for? [A:] dog hospitals and sometimes medical treatment  [Q:] What happens if a dog is hit by a car? [A:] the owner, has to pay for any damage done to the car,  [Q:] but what if the dog is killed? [A:] even if your dog has been killed in the accident.  [Q:] What does Catherine do for work? [A:] secretary  [Q:] Does Tom bother most people? [A:] No  [Q:] What does she consider Tom as? [A:] fourth child  [Q:] is treatment for a dog expensive? [A:] Yes  [Q:] Does Tom buy his own food? [A:] No  [Q:] HOw many children does she have besides tom? [A:] Three  [Q:] Does he go to the office with her? [A:] Yes  [Q:] how about shopping? [A:] Yes
A day at the beach. When Sam woke in the morning, he was super excited! Today was the day! It was Sunday, the day that Sam's mom and dad had promised to take Sam to the beach. Sam's grandma had given a pail and shovel to Sam to use in the sand. At breakfast Sam was so excited he was wiggling in his seat! Mom told Sam that they would leave when the big hand on the clock was pointing to the 10, and the little had was pointing to the 12. Mom asked Sam if he would like to help make sandwiches for the trip, and Sam said that he wanted to help. Dad said, "let's make a game of it, we need to make a sandwich for each of us. There are three of us, so we need three sandwiches. Let's count as we make the sandwiches!" Sam counted as mom made the sandwiches, one for dad, one for mom and one for Sam. Then mom started to make another sandwich! "Mom!" said Sam, "we have three sandwiches and that makes one sandwich for each of us." Sam's mom laughed, "You're right Sam!" Sam's mom said she was being silly. [Q:] Why were they making sandwiches? [A:] for the trip  [Q:] How many did they make? [A:] Three  [Q:] Why so many? [A:] There were three people  [Q:] Where are they going? [A:] beach  [Q:] Who all is going along? [A:] Sam, mom, dad  [Q:] Is it the weekend? [A:] yes  [Q:] What day is it?

ATLANTA, Georgia (CNN) -- In 1989, the warnings were dire. The Spike Lee film "Do the Right Thing," critics and columnists said, would provoke violence and disrupt race relations. 

Spike Lee: "I wanted to do a film that would try to show what was happening at the time." 

"This movie is dynamite under every seat," wrote Newsweek's Jack Kroll. 

Other commentators believed the film would harm the candidacy of David Dinkins, an African-American who was running for mayor of New York. It might even spark riots at movie theaters, they thought. 

Instead, what the film provoked was ... talk. There were no riots. Dinkins was elected. "Do the Right Thing" had a successful run at the box office -- if not as successful as Lee and his supporters hoped -- and was nominated for two Academy Awards. 

Twenty years later, the film still maintains a hold on the imagination. In 2007, the American Film Institute ranked it as one of the 100 best American films. Roger Ebert, who has written he cried when he first saw the film at the Cannes Film Festival, still considers the film a wonder: "Spike Lee had done an almost impossible thing. He'd made a movie about race in America that empathized with all the participants," he wrote in 2001. 

So what is the thing about "Do the Right Thing?" Watch Spike Lee describe things in his own words » 

Part of its staying power is in its boldness, both in look and action. Lee's first two films, "She's Gotta Have It" (1986) and "School Daze" (1988), had marked him as a rising young filmmaker. But it was "Do the Right Thing," made when Lee was just 32, that showcased his confidence, from the deliberately striking color scheme (bright reds and oranges that make a hot day seem even hotter) to its heightened -- sometimes stagy -- atmosphere, to its grim, documentary-style riot climax.  [Q:] Who created Do the Right Thing? [A:] Spike Lee  [Q:] When? [A:] 1989  [Q:] Why were newspaper writers concerned? [A:] they said it would provoke violence and disrupt race relations  [Q:] Were they right? [A:] no  [Q:] Was the movie successful? [A:] yes  [Q:] Was it nominated for any awards?

CHAPTER XXV. THE VELVET COACH 



No, my good Lord, Diana-- ALL'S WELL THAT ENDS WELL 

A late autumn journey from the west coast to Paris was a more serious undertaking in the sixteenth century than the good seaman Master Hobbs was aware of, or he would have used stronger dissuasive measures against such an undertaking by the two youths, when the elder was in so frail a state of health; but there had been a certain deceptive strength and vigour about young Ribaumont while under strong excitement and determination, and the whole party fancied him far fitter to meet the hardships than was really the case. Philip Thistlewood always recollected that journey as the most distressing period of his life. 

They were out of the ordinary highways, and therefore found the hiring of horses often extremely difficult. They had intended to purchase, but found no animals that, as Philip said, they would have accepted as a gift, though at every wretched inn where they had to wait while the country was scoured for the miserable jades, their proposed requirements fell lower and lower. Dens of smoke, dirt, and boorishness were the great proportion of those inns, where they were compelled to take refuge by the breaking down of one or other of the beasts, or by stress of weather. Snow, rain, thaw and frost alternated, each variety rendering the roads impassable; and at the best, the beasts could seldom be urged beyond a walk, fetlock-deep in mire or water. Worse than all, Berenger, far from recovered, and under the heavy oppression of a heartrending grief, could hardly fail to lose the ground that he had gained under the influence of hope. The cold seemed to fix itself on the wound on his cheek, terrible pain and swelling set in, depriving him entirely of sleep, permitting him to take no nourishment but fragments of soft crumbs soaked in wine or broth--when the inns afforded any such fare--and rendering speech excessively painful, and at last unintelligible.  [Q:] What time of year was it? [A:] autumn  [Q:] who was described as having a deceptive strenght and vigor? [A:] Ribaumont  [Q:] What was it that was diffuclt for them to hire? [A:] horses  [Q:] Where was it they were traveling from? [A:] the west coast  [Q:] to where? [A:] to Paris  [Q:] Was was rendering the roads they were traveling impassable?

[A:] Dens of smoke, dirt, and boorishness were the great proportion  [Q:] And why is it that they were compelled to stay in those inn? [A:] breaking down  of the beasts  [Q:] Who was it that was far from recovered, had a wound on his cheek, and was deprived of sleep? [A:] Berenger  [Q:] what was the only thing he was able to eat? [A:] soft crumbs  [Q:] how was his speech? [A:] unintelligible.  [Q:] Who recollected the Jurney from the west coast to Paris was the most distressing period of their life? [A:] Philip Thistlewood
When William Stidger taught at Boston University, he once thought about the people he hadn't thanked in his life. They taught him, encouraged him or cared a lot about him. One was a teacher. She once taught William geography, and William loved geography all his life. So he wrote a letter of thanks to her. He got the teacher's letter later. It began, "My dear Willie." He was very happy. Now over 50, he didn't think someone would call him "Willie". Here is that letter. My dear Willie, I can't tell you how much your letter meant to me. I am in my eighties, living alone in a small room and cooking my own meals. You will be interested to know that I taught school for 50 years and yours is the first letter of appreciation I ever got. It came on a cold morning and it made me feel very warm. ... William cried when he read the letter. She was one of the people that William hadn't thanked in his past. She helped him to believe in himself. He would never forget her. There are some people we should always remember, because they helped to shape our life. William Stidger found a way to show his appreciation--he wrote them letters. Who are some of the people that you need to say thank you to in your past? It may not be too late to say "Thanks". [Q:] who was someone in his life that William wanted otothank. [A:] a teacher  [Q:] what was her name? [A:] unknown  [Q:] what subject had she taught him? [A:] geography  [Q:] did he enjoy the subject? [A:] yes  [Q:] how did he decide to express his gratitude? [A:] he wrote a letter  [Q:] had she received such a note before? [A:] no  [Q:] did she write back? [A:] yes  [Q:] how did she address him? [A:] Willie  [Q:] did anyone call him that these days? [A:] no  [Q:] how long was her teaching career? [A:] 50 years  [Q:] how did William react to her message? [A:] he cried  [Q:] how old was she when he wrote to her? [A:] her eighties  [Q:] how did the note make her feel? [A:] it meant a lot to her
Louisiana is a state located in the Southern United States. Louisiana is the 31st most extensive and the 25th most populous of the 50 United States. Its capital is Baton Rouge and largest city is New Orleans. Louisiana is the only state in the U.S. with political subdivisions termed parishes, which are the local government's equivalent to counties. The largest parish by population is East Baton Rouge Parish, and the largest by total area is Plaquemines. Louisiana is bordered by Arkansas to the north, Mississippi to the east, Texas to the west, and the Gulf of Mexico to the south. 

Much of the state's lands were formed from sediment washed down the Mississippi River, leaving enormous deltas and vast areas of coastal marsh and swamp. These contain a rich southern biota; typical examples include birds such as ibis and egrets. There are also many species of tree frogs, and fish such as sturgeon and paddlefish. In more elevated areas, fire is a natural process in the landscape, and has produced extensive areas of longleaf pine forest and wet savannas. These support an exceptionally large number of plant species, including many species of orchids and carnivorous plants. Louisiana has more Native American tribes than any other southern state, including four that are federally recognized, ten that are state recognized, and four that have not yet received recognition. [Q:] Which southern state has the most tribes? [A:] Louisiana  [Q:] How many in total? [A:] 18  [Q:] Are there any not recognized? [A:] yes  [Q:] How many? [A:] four  [Q:] How many do the feds recognize? [A:] four  [Q:] What about the state? [A:] 10  [Q:] Where is LA located? [A:] in the Southern United States  [Q:] How does it rank as far as people? [A:] 25th  [Q:] And in size? [A:] 31st  [Q:] What are the counties known as? [A:] parishes  [Q:] Do other states have these? [A:] no  [Q:] What is the capitol?

Shelly is in second grade. She is a new student at her school. Shelly's family has lived in many different places. Shelly was born in Florida. Her family moved to Tennessee when she was two years old. When she was four years old, they moved to Texas. They moved from there to Arizona, where they now live. 

Shelly is upset because she does not have any friends at her new school. She misses her old school. She had lots of friends at her old school. She really misses her best friend, Julie. 

When she gets to school on the first day, she feels very nervous. She wants to go back to her other school. She even misses Mrs. Bell, her first grade teacher. 

Her new teacher, Mrs. Borden, makes her stand in front of the class and say something about herself. She is so embarrassed! She is told to sit between two boys, Tim and John. 

When it is time for lunch, Mrs. Borden picks Shelly to lead the line. Maybe, she's not so bad after all, Shelly thinks. 

At lunch, she meets Mrs. Stewart. Mrs. Stewart works in the school office. She is very nice. 

Shelly finds a seat in the lunchroom. She smiles at the girl next to her. The girl's name is Sue. She is very nice to Shelly. She even shares a cookie with Shelly. Shelly is very happy that she has a new friend. [Q:] What grade is Shelly in ? [A:] second  [Q:] Was she a new student ? [A:] Yes  [Q:] Where did she move at 2 years old ? [A:] Tennessee  [Q:] where do there live now ? [A:] Arizona  [Q:] why is she upset ? [A:] she does not have any friends  [Q:] Who is Julie ? [A:] best friend,  [Q:] Who is mrs bell ?

Climate is the statistics of weather over long periods of time. It is measured by assessing the patterns of variation in temperature, humidity, atmospheric pressure, wind, precipitation, atmospheric particle count and other meteorological variables in a given region over long periods of time. Climate differs from weather, in that weather only describes the short-term conditions of these variables in a given region. 

A region's climate is generated by the climate system, which has five components: atmosphere, hydrosphere, cryosphere, lithosphere, and biosphere. 

The climate of a location is affected by its latitude, terrain, and altitude, as well as nearby water bodies and their currents. Climates can be classified according to the average and the typical ranges of different variables, most commonly temperature and precipitation. The most commonly used classification scheme was the Köppen climate classification. The Thornthwaite system, in use since 1948, incorporates evapotranspiration along with temperature and precipitation information and is used in studying biological diversity and how climate change affects it. The Bergeron and Spatial Synoptic Classification systems focus on the origin of air masses that define the climate of a region. 

Paleoclimatology is the study of ancient climates. Since direct observations of climate are not available before the 19th century, paleoclimates are inferred from proxy variables that include non-biotic evidence such as sediments found in lake beds and ice cores, and biotic evidence such as tree rings and coral. Climate models are mathematical models of past, present and future climates. Climate change may occur over long and short timescales from a variety of factors; recent warming is discussed in global warming. Global warming results in redistributions. For example, "a 3°C change in mean annual temperature corresponds to a shift in isotherms of approximately 300–400 km in latitude (in the temperate zone) or 500 m in elevation. Therefore, species are expected to move upwards in elevation or towards the poles in latitude in response to shifting climate zones". [Q:] Were direct observations of the climate around before the 19th century? [A:] No.  [Q:] What is paleocimatology? [A:] The study of ancient climates.  [Q:] What are those climates called? [A:] Paleoclimates.  [Q:] What kind of variables are used to study them? [A:] Proxy variables.  [Q:] What are two categories that the evidence falls under? [A:] Non-biotic and biotic.  [Q:] Which one are sediments? [A:] Non-biotic.  [Q:] Where do scientists gather those? [A:] In lake beds.  [Q:] Anywhere else? [A:] Ice cores,  [Q:] Do you know of any biotic evidence? [A:] Yes.  [Q:] What? [A:] Tree rings.  [Q:] Anything else? [A:] Coral.  [Q:] What is climate? [A:] Statistics of weather over long periods of time.  [Q:] Is it the same as weather? [A:] No.  [Q:] What is the difference? [A:] Weather only describes the short-term conditions.  [Q:] What kind of patterns are examined to measure climate? [A:] Variation in temperature.  [Q:] anything else? [A:] humidity, atmospheric pressure, wind, precipitation.  [Q:] Are they studied regionally or for the whole world? [A:] Regionally.  [Q:] What creates a region's climate? [A:] The climate system.  [Q:] How many parts does it have? [A:] Five.  [Q:] Is one of them the atmosphere? [A:] Yes.
A gene is a locus (or region) of DNA that encodes a functional RNA or protein product, and is the molecular unit of heredity.:Glossary The transmission of genes to an organism's offspring is the basis of the inheritance of phenotypic traits. Most biological traits are under the influence of polygenes (many different genes) as well as the gene–environment interactions. Some genetic traits are instantly visible, such as eye colour or number of limbs, and some are not, such as blood type, risk for specific diseases, or the thousands of basic biochemical processes that comprise life. 

Genes can acquire mutations in their sequence, leading to different variants, known as alleles, in the population. These alleles encode slightly different versions of a protein, which cause different phenotype traits. Colloquial usage of the term "having a gene" (e.g., "good genes," "hair colour gene") typically refers to having a different allele of the gene. Genes evolve due to natural selection or survival of the fittest of the alleles. [Q:] do genes evolve? [A:] Yes  [Q:] what are polygenes? [A:] many different genes  [Q:] are all genetic traits visible? [A:] No  [Q:] can genes mutate? [A:] Yes  [Q:] what are different variants of genes called? [A:] alleles  [Q:] how many specific genetic traits are named? [A:] Five  [Q:] what is a locus also called? [A:] Region  [Q:] is eye color visible? [A:] Yes  [Q:] is blood type visible? [A:] No  [Q:] are genes related to DNA? [A:] Yes  [Q:] what is a gene? [A:] DNA that encodes a functional RNA or protein product
CHAPTER XII 

MOLLY SIZER'S PARTY 

The people of Chazy County were very proud of the _Millville Tribune_, the only daily paper in that section of the state. It was really a very good newspaper, if small in size, and related the news of the day as promptly as the great New York journals did. 

Arthur Weldon had not been very enthusiastic about the paper at any time, although he humored the girls by attending in a good-natured way to the advertising, hiring some of the country folk to get subscriptions, and keeping the books. He was a young man of considerable education who had inherited a large fortune, safely invested, and therefore had no need, through financial necessity, to interest himself in business of any sort. He allowed the girls to print his name as editor in chief, but he did no editorial work at all, amusing himself these delightful summer days by wandering in the woods, where he collected botanical specimens, or sitting with Uncle John on the lawn, where they read together or played chess. Both the men were glad the girls were happy in their work and enthusiastic over the success of their audacious venture. Beth was developing decided talent as a writer of editorials and her articles were even more thoughtful and dignified than were those of Patsy. The two girls found plenty to occupy them at the office, while Louise did the reportorial work and flitted through Millville and down to Huntingdon each day in search of small items of local interest. She grew fond of this work, for it brought her close to the people and enabled her to study their characters and peculiarities. Her manner of approaching the simple country folk was so gracious and winning that they freely gave her any information they possessed, and chatted with her unreservedly.  [Q:] How many daily papers were there in town?? [A:] one  [Q:] What was it called? [A:] the Millville Tribune  [Q:] Whose enthusiasm in the publication had gone down? [A:] Arthur's  [Q:] Was he a poor man? [A:] no  [Q:] How had he become wealthy? [A:] he inherited a large fortune  [Q:] What was his title at the paper? [A:] editor in chief  [Q:] Did he have many tasks associated with it? [A:] no  [Q:] Who actually ran it? [A:] the girls  [Q:] What were their names?

The Royal Victorian Order () is a dynastic order of knighthood established in 1896 by Queen Victoria. It recognises distinguished personal service to the monarch of the Commonwealth realms, members of the monarch's family, or to any viceroy or senior representative of the monarch. The present monarch, Queen Elizabeth II, is the Sovereign of the order, its motto is "Victoria", and its official day is 20 June. The order's chapel is the Savoy Chapel in London. 

There are no limits on the number honoured, and admission remains at the sole discretion of the monarch, with each of the order's five grades and one medal with three levels representing different levels of service. While all those honoured may use the prescribed styles of the order—the top two grades grant titles of knighthood, and all grades accord distinct post-nominal letters—the Royal Victorian Order's precedence amongst other honours differs from realm to realm and admission to some grades may be barred to citizens of those realms by government policy. 

Prior to the close of the 19th century, most general honours within the British Empire were bestowed by the sovereign on the advice of her British ministers, who sometimes forwarded advice from ministers of the Crown in the Dominions and colonies (appointments to the then most senior orders of chivalry—the Most Noble Order of the Garter and the Most Ancient and Most Noble Order of the Thistle—had been made on ministerial advice since the 18th century and were not restored to the personal gift of the sovereign until 1946 and 1947, respectively). Queen Victoria thus established on 21 April 1896 the Royal Victorian Order as a junior and personal order of knighthood that allowed her to bestow directly to an empire-wide community honours for personal services. The organisation was founded a year preceding Victoria's Diamond Jubilee, so as to give the Queen time to complete a list of first inductees. The order's official day was made 20 June of each year, marking the anniversary of Queen Victoria's accession to the throne. [Q:] What is the name of the order being discussed? [A:] The Royal Victorian Order  [Q:] What type of order is it? [A:] a dynastic order of knighthood  [Q:] Where is its chapel? [A:] Savoy Chapel  [Q:] Before the 19th century, who gave honors? [A:] bestowed by the sovereign on the advice of her British ministers,  [Q:] What is the official day of the order? [A:] 20 June.  [Q:] What's the date mark? [A:] Queen Victoria's accession to the throne.  [Q:] When did she create the order? [A:] 1896  [Q:] On what day? [A:] 21 April 1896  [Q:] What's its motto? [A:] "Victoria"  [Q:] What type of service does it reward? [A:] distinguished personal service  [Q:] How many can be rewarded? [A:] unlimited
CHAPTER LXIV. 

"Questa montagna e tale, Che sempre al cominciar di sotto a grave. E quanto uom piu va su e men fa male." --DANTE: _Il Purgatorio_. 

It was not many days after her mother's arrival that Gwendolen would consent to remain at Genoa. Her desire to get away from that gem of the sea, helped to rally her strength and courage. For what place, though it were the flowery vale of Enna, may not the inward sense turn into a circle of punishment where the flowers are no better than a crop of flame-tongues burning the soles of our feet? 

"I shall never like to see the Mediterranean again," said Gwendolen, to her mother, who thought that she quite understood her child's feeling--even in her tacit prohibition of any express reference to her late husband. 

Mrs. Davilow, indeed, though compelled formally to regard this time as one of severe calamity, was virtually enjoying her life more than she had ever done since her daughter's marriage. It seemed that her darling was brought back to her not merely with all the old affection, but with a conscious cherishing of her mother's nearness, such as we give to a possession that we have been on the brink of losing. 

"Are you there, mamma?" cried Gwendolen, in the middle of the night (a bed had been made for her mother in the same room with hers), very much as she would have done in her early girlhood, if she had felt frightened in lying awake.  [Q:] Who cries out? [A:] Gwendolen  [Q:] When? [A:] in the middle of the night  [Q:] For whom? [A:] her mother  [Q:] Was there a bed for her? [A:] yes  [Q:] Where? [A:] in the same room with hers  [Q:] What language is the quote that starts this? [A:] Italian  [Q:] Is there a translation? [A:] no  [Q:] What does Gwen never want to see again? [A:] the Mediterranean  [Q:] What did she consent to do? [A:] to remain at Genoa  [Q:] How long had she done that after her mom came? [A:] not many days after  [Q:] What's Genoa nicknamed? [A:] flowery vale of Enna  [Q:] Does Enna have many flowers? [A:] yes  [Q:] Does her mom understand how Gwen feels? [A:] no  [Q:] Is her mom enjoying her life now that Gwen's married? [A:] yes  [Q:] Was she forced to view this time as one of calamity? [A:] yes  [Q:] What was one of the things that Gwens desire to get away helped her rally? [A:] strength  [Q:] And the other? [A:] courage  [Q:] Did it become punishing to remain there? [A:] yes
(CNN) -- SeaWorld will resume killer whale shows while the company and two federal agencies investigate the death of a whale trainer at SeaWorld Orlando, company and federal officials announced Friday. 

The shows, which were suspended at all SeaWorld locations after the death Wednesday at SeaWorld Orlando, will resume Saturday with new precautionary measures in place, said Jim Atchison, president of SeaWorld Parks & Entertainment. 

Earlier Friday, the Labor Department's Occupational Safety and Health Administration and the Agriculture Department's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service announced they were looking into the death of Dawn Brancheau, 40. 

Brancheau was pulled underwater when a killer whale named Tilikum grabbed her ponytail. A source at SeaWorld said that after seizing her, the whale dove deep underwater. Trainers eventually had to wrangle the animal into a smaller pool before they could retrieve her body about 40 minutes later. 

WESH: Watch tourist's video just before attack 

A former head of animal training said Friday that Brancheau left herself vulnerable to attack and that she may have broken the park's training protocol. 

"Dawn, if she was standing here right now, would tell you that that was her mistake in allowing that to happen," said former SeaWorld trainer Thad Lacinak, who had worked with Brancheau in the past, on ABC's "Good Morning America."

Chapter XL. Keep Your Temper. 

On the next day but one, Randal arranged his departure for Sydenham, so as to arrive at the hotel an hour before the time appointed for the dinner. His prospects of success, in pleading for a favorable reception of his brother's message, were so uncertain that he refrained--in fear of raising hopes which he might not be able to justify--from taking Herbert into his confidence. No one knew on what errand he was bent, when he left the house. As he took his place in the carriage, the newspaper boy appeared at the window as usual. The new number of a popular weekly journal had that day been published. Randal bought it. 

After reading one or two of the political articles, he arrived at the columns specially devoted to "Fashionable Intelligence." Caring nothing for that sort of news, he was turning over the pages in search of the literary and dramatic articles, when a name not unfamiliar to him caught his eye. He read the paragraph in which it appeared. 

"The charming widow, Mrs. Norman, is, we hear, among the distinguished guests staying at Buck's Hotel. It is whispered that the lady is to be shortly united to a retired naval officer of Arctic fame; now better known, perhaps, as one of our leading philanthropists." 

The allusion to Bennydeck was too plain to be mistaken. Randal looked again at the first words in the paragraph. "The charming widow!" Was it possible that this last word referred to Catherine? To suppose her capable of assuming to be a widow, and--if the child asked questions--of telling Kitty that her father was dead, was, in Randal's estimation, to wrong her cruelly. With his own suspicions steadily contradicting him, he arrived at the hotel, obstinately believing that "the charming widow" would prove to be a stranger.  [Q:] how many articles were read ?

Robots are smart. With their computer brains, they help people work in dangerous places or do difficult jobs. Some robots do regular jobs. Bobby, the robot mail carrier, brings mail to a large office building in Washington, D.C. He is one of 250 robot mail carriers in the United States. Mr. Leachim, who weights two hundred pounds and is six feet tall, has some advantages as a teacher. One is that he does not forget details. He knows each child's name, their parents' names, and what each child knows and needs to know. In addition, he knows each child's pets and hobbies. Mr. Leachim does not make mistakes. Each child goes and tells him his or her name, then dials an identification number. His computer brain puts the child's voice and number together. He identifies the child with no mistakes. 

Another advantage is that Mr. Leachim is flexible. If the children need more time to do their lessons they can move switches. In this way they can repeat Mr. Leachim's lesson over and over again. When the children do a good job, he tells them something interesting about their hobbies. At the end of the lesson the children switch Mr. Leachim off. [Q:] how tall is Mr. Leachim? [A:] Six feet.  [Q:] and how much does he weigh? [A:] 200 pounds.  [Q:] does he keep track of all the details about the children? [A:] Yes.  [Q:] is he a robot? [A:] Yes.  [Q:] what does he have for a brain?

Douglas loves to play soccer. He plays for the Dolphins. He is very good. He was excited about the big game with the Lions. The night before the game, he went to bed late. He was watching three TV shows that night. First, was Muffins the Cat. The second show was Ernie the Talking Donkey. The third was Laughing with Herman Hamster. His Mom told him to go to bed, but Douglas didn't listen. He fell asleep on the couch. He dreamed all night. First about sheep jumping fences. Second about playing fetch the ball with Ruffles. Third about Ernie the talking Donkey kicking a soccer ball over the moon. Fourth about his favorite soccer player, Pele, head the ball in the goal. 

Finally, the next morning, Douglas got up late because he was so tired. His Mom called him and the alarm went off, but he did not hear. To get Douglas up, his Mom got Ruffles the dog to lick him in the face. Douglas got up but had to eat breakfast fast. Then he quickly dressed into his uniform. He was yawning. 

His Mom drove him to the soccer field. The game had started. Douglas had to sit out the first quarter. His team was losing one to nothing when Howard scored for the Lions. Douglas started the second quarter. He was tired and could not keep up with the rest of his team. The coach was surprised that Douglas was so slow. Usually he was fast. After the second quarter, the Dolphins were losing two to one after Howard scored again for the Lions and Toby scored a goal for the Dolphins. While the coach gave energy drinks to the team, Douglas fell asleep. The third quarter started. 

Douglas was snoring when the coach told him to go in. When he saw Douglas was sleeping, he sent Billy into the game. Billy scored one goal and the Dolphins had tied the game two to two. Ruffles the dog started barking and then licking Douglas in the face. Douglas got up and stretched. He was finally well rested. The coach saw Douglas and sent him into the game. Douglas remembered his dream. In the last second, he headed the ball in the goal like Pele. He won the game. The team cheered. 

Since that time, Douglas goes to bed on time. He always wants to be well rested. His Mom was right. He gave her a hug. [Q:] DId the boy have a pet? [A:] yes  [Q:] What kind?

Jessica went to sit in her rocking chair. Today was her birthday and she was turning 80. Her granddaughter Annie was coming over in the afternoon and Jessica was very excited to see her. Her daughter Melanie and Melanie's husband Josh were coming as well. Jessica had a lot to do before they got here, but she was very tired. After taking a nap for half an hour Jessica got up and walked to the drier. She moved the dry clothes into a basket. Next, she took the clothes out of the washer and put them into the drier. She pressed the button on the drier to get it started then walked back out of the room. She also needed to feed her duck. The chickens in her backyard did not need to be fed as they belonged to her neighbor. Jack the dog had been fed earlier that morning and Becky the cat always had food in her bowl. After Jessica finished feeding the duck she came inside and heard the telephone ringing. She answered the phone to hear Annie's excited voice say "Happy birthday grandma!"

Once upon a time there were four children. Each of the children had a favorite color. John's favorite color was blue. Jack's favorite color was red. Jenny's favorite color was purple and Alice's favorite color was yellow. They walked along the road one day and stopped to pick flowers for their mother. Jack picked a handful of red flowers. "Mom is going to love these!" he said. Jenny picked a handful of purple flowers. "These are perfect for mother," She thought. Alice picked two handfuls of yellow flowers. "Yellow flowers are so pretty for mom's kitchen," she said. John looked and looked, but couldn't find any blue flowers. He looked along the road, but there were no blue flowers. He looked by the stream, but there were no blue flowers. He was very sad. They walked along the road toward home to give their flowers to their mother. John walked very slowly and hung his head because he didn't have any flowers to give his mother. As they neared their home, John saw a small bunch of blue flowers growing near the fence. He was so happy he picked them all and rushed to catch up with his brother and sisters. When they got home they gave their mother all the flowers they had picked.

CHAPTER III. 

A RAFT. 

Forester and Marco did not take breakfast on board the steamboat, but waited until they got on shore. They had inquired of a fellow-passenger, who seemed acquainted with the country, and were told that there was a very good tavern about a quarter of a mile from the mill. 

When they landed upon the logs, Marco, whose curiosity seemed to be stronger than his appetite, wanted to ramble about for a little time along the shore and among the piles of boards, but Forester thought it would be best first to go and get their breakfast. 

"Because," said he, "we can then amuse ourselves by rambling about here, and shall be ready to return to the steamboat whenever they send for us." 

So they went to the tavern. 

Forester seemed to have little appetite for his breakfast. He complained of feeling fatigued, and yet he had nothing to fatigue him. Marco ate, and talked fast all the time; but Forester seemed silent and dejected. 

"Come, cousin Forester, what is the matter with you?" said Marco at last. 

Forester said that he felt somewhat unwell, and as there was a sofa in the room, he concluded to lie down upon it, and not go out. Marco was, at first, disposed to stay and take care of him, but Forester said that he did not need anything, and he wished Marco to go out and amuse himself. 

"You may go and see the mill," said he, "and the logs along the shore; only be careful not to go where there is any danger; and come and let me know when the boat is coming from the steamer to take us on board again."  [Q:] What did they land on [A:] the logs  [Q:] Who wanted to walk around [A:] Marco  [Q:] Who wanted to eat [A:] Forester  [Q:] Eat what?

George Zimmerman, set to stand trial in the 2012 shooting death of teenager Trayvon Martin, on Tuesday waived his right to a "stand your ground" pretrial immunity hearing. Zimmerman's attorneys have decided they will try this as a self-defense case. 

Florida's deadly force law, also called "stand your ground", was passed in 2005. It allows people to meet "force with force" if they believe they or someone else is in danger of being seriously harmed by an assailant. Under the law, a person can use deadly force anywhere as long as he is not engaged in an unlawful activity, is being attacked in a place he has a right to be, and reasonably believes that his life and safety are in danger as a result of an overt act or perceived threat committed by someone else. 

In a pretrial immunity hearing, a judge would have ruled whether Zimmerman's actions were protected under the "stand your ground" law; a ruling in favor of the defendant would have meant that no criminal or civil trial could proceed. 

Martin was shot and killed on February 26, 2012, while returning from a nearby convenience store to his father's fiancée's house in a gated community in Sanford, Florida. 

Zimmerman, a neighborhood watch captain, acknowledged that he shot the unarmed 17-year-old, but said Martin physically attacked him and he fired in self-defense. Initially, no charges were pursued, and the case soon became the center of a national controversy. 

Zimmerman was charged with second-degree murder on April 11, 2012.  [Q:] Who was in court on Tuesday? [A:] George Zimmerman  [Q:] What job did he have where he lived? [A:] neighborhood watch captain  [Q:] What was he charged with? [A:] second-degree murder  [Q:] What state is he from? [A:] Florida  [Q:] And what city?

Los Angeles (CNN) -- Dr. Conrad Murray, who was Michael Jackson's personal physician, is refusing to testify in the wrongful death lawsuit that the singer's mother filed against concert promoter AEG Live. 

If called, he will plead the fifth so as not to incriminate himself, the doctor said in a statement sent to the Jackson family. 

Murray has never been questioned under oath about Jackson's death, which occurred on his watch. 

He did not testify at his trial, where he was found guilty of causing Jackson's death on June 25, 2009, by administering a deadly overdose of sedatives and the surgical anesthetic propofol in what he told police was an attempt to cure the singer's insomnia. 

He is serving a four-year sentence but could be out in two. 

On Monday, he was supposed to be deposed in the wrongful death suit. 

But lawyers for Jackson's mother, Katherine, and her three children called off their jailhouse visit because Murray swore "he would not answer any questions at the deposition or the trial," Jackson lawyer Kevin Boyle told CNN. 

He said the Jackson case would not suffer without his testimony. 

AEG's lawyer suggests the Jacksons canceled Murray's deposition because his testimony would "destroy" their case. 

"They are not interested in the truth," said the lawyer, Marvin Putnam. 

Asserting his 'Fifth Amendment privilege' 

The cancellation came after Murray's attorney Valerie Wass sent the Jacksons a sworn statement signed by Murray making it clear he would not answer any questions while his involuntary manslaughter conviction in Michael Jackson's death is being appealed.  [Q:] Who was the singer's doctor? [A:] Conrad Murray  [Q:] Is he involved in the lawsuit? [A:] he refused to testify in it  [Q:] Who filed the lawsuit? [A:] the singer's mother  [Q:] Against who?

[A:] 2009  [Q:] He died of what? [A:] an overdose  [Q:] Of what? [A:] sedatives  [Q:] And what else? [A:] Yes  [Q:] What is the singer's mother's name? [A:] Katherine

John was in the third grade, and nine years old. Every day he had to walk home from school.

She was mean, but John liked her because she was pretty and did not want her to get in trouble. 

One day, his teacher asked John to stay after class to wipe off the chalkboard and to empty the pencil sharpener. By the time he was done, the other kids had gone home. They could no longer throw snowballs at him. John did not mind helping out his teacher, and he soon stayed after class every day.

A young mother had a child that was in kindergarten. One day, the class took a trip to the zoo. This was the start of a very good day. The child had a lot of fun. The animals were very friendly, and the friendliest of all was a baby tiger, which the child called 'kitty'. The mother laughed when her child asked to see a unicorn. Instead, she gave her daughter a cookie and they had some ham sandwiches for lunch. They had lunch by the stone benches in the park area. There was a trashcan nearby. The mother threw their trash in the trashcan when they were done. Then they went to go see the pigs. The pigs made a noise like 'oink'. There were also cows. There was also a slide.

The Christian Science Monitor (CSM) is an international news organization that delivers global coverage via its website, weekly magazine, daily news briefing, email newsletters, Amazon Kindle subscription, and mobile site. It was started in 1908 by Mary Baker Eddy, the founder of the Church of Christ, Scientist. , the print circulation was 75,052. 

The "Monitor" is a newspaper that covers international and United States current events. The paper includes a daily religious feature on "The Home Forum" page, but states the publication is not a platform for evangelizing. 

In 2008 the "Monitor" discontinued its daily print version to focus on web-based publishing, replacing its daily print edition with a weekly news magazine with an international focus. Mark Sappenfield became the editor in March of 2017. 

Despite its name, the "Monitor" does not claim to be a religious-themed paper, and says it does not promote the doctrine of its patron church. However, at its founder Eddy's request, a daily religious article has appeared in every issue of the "Monitor". Eddy also required the inclusion of "Christian Science" in the paper's name, over initial opposition by some of her advisors who thought the religious reference might repel a secular audience. 

The "Monitor"'s inception was, in part, a response by Eddy to the journalism of her day, which relentlessly covered the sensations and scandals surrounding her new religion with varying degrees of accuracy. In addition, Joseph Pulitzer's "New York World" was consistently critical of Eddy, and this, along with a derogatory article in "McClure's", furthered Eddy's decision to found her own media outlet.

Cork was originally a monastic settlement, reputedly founded by Saint Finbarr in the 6th century. Cork achieved an urban character at some point between 915 and 922 when Norseman (Viking) settlers founded a trading port. It has been proposed that, like Dublin, Cork was an important trading centre in the global Scandinavian trade network. The ecclesiastical settlement continued alongside the Viking longphort, with the two developing a type of symbiotic relationship; the Norsemen providing otherwise unobtainable trade goods for the monastery, and perhaps also military aid. 

The city's charter was granted by Prince John, as Lord of Ireland, in 1185. The city was once fully walled, and some wall sections and gates remain today. For much of the Middle Ages, Cork city was an outpost of Old English culture in the midst of a predominantly hostile Gaelic countryside and cut off from the English government in the Pale around Dublin.

There was once a pig named Oink, who lived on a farm, but spent most of his days in a factory making shoes. In his free time, he would make drawings about how much he wished he could fly. He would look up at the stars in wonder, hoping that some day, his dream might come true. For many years, his life carried on this way. He would wake up on the farm, go to work, and then come home to dream about flying. That is, until one day, he got a letter with a strange sticker on it, that was shaped like a star. He opened the letter in excitement, wondering what it said. The letter said that Oink was invited to a special party that took place every year in the clouds. Animals from all across the world were chosen so that they could know what it's like to fly. If he chose to go to the party, he would get his own set of wings to fly up into the sky and meet the other animals. Oink was so happy, he barely knew how to react. He accepted the invitation, and two days later, got a package containing his wings. Oink's dream was finally coming true. He put the wings on his back and flew up into the sky, where the party was being held. Once he arrived, he saw a bunch of other animals with wings also. He saw horses, dogs, cats, and plenty of birds. Oink had found out that it was the birds who had invited everyone, since they wanted the other animals to know what it is like to fly. Oink spent that day flying in the clouds with his new friends. But when the clock reached midnight, he knew his time flying was up, and he had to return the wings and go back to his farm. But the birds told him that they saw how much he enjoyed flying, and would allow him to keep his wings so he could fly with them whenever he wanted. Oink was really thankful, and next time he saw the birds, gave them their own pair of shoes for free as a thank you gift. [Q:] What was Oink? [A:] a pig  [Q:] Where did he live?

Sydney (CNN) -- Kevin Rudd and Tony Abbott, the two men vying to be Australia's prime minister in the September 7 national election, offer contrasting views on China, the country that looms largest on Australia's economic and strategic horizon. 

Rudd, the Chinese-speaking incumbent prime minister in the Labor-led government, says the China resources boom is over and Australia needs to prepare for that transition, given how important China has become as a trade partner in the past decade. 

China is a key destination for Australian resources such as iron ore, coal and LNG. But in recent months, even China's breakneck economic pace has hit some speed bumps. 

On the broader geopolitical front, Rudd wants China and the United States to carve out a new Asia-Pacific "strategic road-map" that will enhance trade, investment and security in the region.

The Opposition's view on China 

Abbott, who has led the opposition Liberal Party since 2009, wants the Australia-China relationship to move from one based on shared interests to one of "shared values." 

But he notes that Australia's friendship with China is more recent than that with Japan, and less developed than that with the United States. 

In a major policy speech to a business audience in Beijing last year, Abbott said he believed it would take time before Australia's ties with China approached "the warmth that we take for granted with America." Still, he believes it is an effort worth making. 

Like his mentor, former Australian prime minister John Howard, Abbott is a rock-solid supporter of Australia's military alliance with the United States, and believes that it is possible to be friends both with Washington and Beijing. Howard, he said, "understood that you could make a new friend without losing an old one."  [Q:] Who has led the Liberal Party? [A:] Tony Abbott  [Q:] Who is he running against?

I never wanted a dog, but now I'm so glad I have one. About two years ago, my wife, Cathy, got a little dog with a face only a mother could love. We named her Gertie. Gertie is the kind of dog that has to grow on you. So I dicided that the dog would be trained. This didn't quite go as planned. At 15 weeks old, she was nearly made to leave the Petsmart Training School. She spent every night lying in our bed-snoring so loudly that I hardly got a good night's sleep. Then, about six months after she arrived, I felt that something in my heart was taking place, and I was unable to stop it. My behaviour began to change. I began to smile at people when passing them in a street. I returned from neighbours. I started calling my kids, and to my surprise, they started calling me. I even tried to speak to my grandchildren over the phone once. I even was glad to listen to laughter from a 10-month-old granddaughter. The point is that I was changing. My wife and I both agree that it is Gertie who has changed my behaviour. Gertie is now nearly two years old and almost fully grown.I have come to like the pet little by little, though she is my wife's dog. [Q:] What is my dog's name? [A:] Gertie  [Q:] What does she look like? [A:] little dog with a face only a mother could love.  [Q:] Is she obedient? [A:] no  [Q:] Did she go to training? [A:] yes  [Q:] Where?

(CNN) -- Manchester City thrashed Sunderland 5-0 to keep alive their slim English Premier League title hopes and to cement their position in the top four Champions League places. 

England international Adam Johnson, making his first start since injuring his ankle in January, opened the scoring in the ninth minute while captain Carlos Tevez doubled the Blues' advantage on the quarter hour from the penalty spot. 

Second-half strikes from David Silva, Patrick Vieira and Yaya Toure completed the rout as City went above reigning champions Chelsea into third in the standings. 

They are six points clear of fifth-placed Tottenham, who pipped them for the final Champions League place last season, but have played a game more. 

Leaders Manchester United have a seven-point lead over Arsenal, who have played a game less, with their neighbors City 10 points adrift. 

The strikes from Johnson, who exchanged passes with Toure before finishing neatly, and Tevez, who was fouled by Michael Turner to draw the penalty, effectively ended the match as a contest with City always in command against a Sunderland side in poor recent form. 

Silva scored after a Mario Balotelli shot was blocked, Vieira with his first touch after coming off the bench and Toure after an error by Sunderland captain Lee Cattermole. 

City's Dutch international Nigel de Jong said the result was important for their Champions League ambitions. 

"There are still seven games to go and anything can happen but this is a great confidence boost for our team -- we are real contenders for the Champions League places." he told Sky Sports.

A social class (or, simply, class), as in class society, is a set of subjectively defined concepts in the social sciences and political theory centered on models of social stratification in which people are grouped into a set of hierarchical social categories, the most common being the upper, middle, and lower classes. 

Class is a subject of analysis for sociologists, political scientists, anthropologists, and social historians. However, there is not a consensus on a definition of "class", and the term has a wide range of sometimes conflicting meanings. In common parlance, the term "social class" is usually synonymous with "socio-economic class", defined as "people having the same social, economic, cultural, political or educational status", e.g., "the working class"; "an emerging professional class". However, academics distinguish social class and socioeconomic status, with the former referring to one’s relatively stable sociocultural background and the latter referring to one’s current social and economic situation and, consequently, being more changeable over time. 

The precise measurements of what determines social class in society has varied over time. Karl Marx thought "class" was defined by one's relationship to the means of production (their relations of production). His simple understanding of classes in modern capitalist society, are the proletariat, those who work but do not own the means of production; and the bourgeoisie, those who invest and live off of the surplus generated by the former. This contrasts with the view of the sociologist Max Weber, who argued "class" is determined by economic position, in contrast to "social status" or ""Stand"" which is determined by social prestige rather than simply just relations of production. [Q:] What is one group that analyzes classes? [A:] sociologists  [Q:] Ad another? [A:] political scientists  [Q:] And one more? [A:] anthropologists  [Q:] Does everyone agree on what class means? [A:] No  [Q:] Which two terms are generally the same in common usage? [A:] "social class" and "socio-economic class"  [Q:] Do scholars think they are the same? [A:] No  [Q:] True or False: Scholars consider social class to be more changeable than the other term. [A:] False  [Q:] What are the three most common class groupings? [A:] unknown  [Q:] By what relationship did Marx define class? [A:] the means of production  [Q:] Which group did not own that means? [A:] proletariat  [Q:] What is the other group called? [A:] bourgeoisie  [Q:] What did they live off? [A:] surplus generated by the former  [Q:] What kind of society did Mark see these classes in? [A:] modern capitalist society  [Q:] Was his theory very complex? [A:] No  [Q:] Did Weber have the same ideas? [A:] No  [Q:] What did Weber think class was decided by? [A:] economic position
The cat woke up from its nap under the couch. Poking his head out from under the couch, there were no dogs there. He walked out from under the couch and stretched out his paws along the hard wood floor. Far outside there was some barking from the dogs, but he was safe from them for now. The smell of tuna was in the air and the cat followed the scent to the kitchen. A woman was making a tuna sandwich for her two kids. When she finished, she put the tuna can on to the floor. The cat slowly walked up to the can and saw some juice inside. He licked up the yummy tuna juice and was sad when it was all gone. The woman brought the tuna sandwiches over to her sons at the table, then she opened the back door to let the dogs in. The cat's fur stood on end as the dogs came running after him. He ran away into the other and back to under the couch where it was safe. [Q:] Were there dogs there? [A:] no  [Q:] What could be heard? [A:] barking  [Q:] What did the cat smell?

There is a large tree in a park where all the kids in the neighborhood can hang out and play. The tree was planted in 1896 and has grown to over fifty feet tall with branches that were another thirty feet wide. Next to the tree is a jungle gym. The jungle gym has two slides, a fireman pole, a rock climbing wall, and much more. One day the kids in the neighborhood came up with the idea of building a tree house so they could spend all of their time at the park, even when it was raining outside. The children all went to their parents begging them to help and get wood. The families of the neighborhood began building the master tree house. Upon completion the tree house was ten by twelve feet high, with two windows, and plenty of space for the children to have fun. Every day during the summer that year the children played in the park and went in the tree house from sunrise to sunset every day. Fifteen years have gone by and the children are now too old to use the tree house. The tree house still sits on the tree but instead has a new group of kids that get to enjoy the house. Now the first kids have become parents and get to watch their idea live on and make the children of the neighborhood happy. [Q:] Where is the tree?

Josie could hear the birds singing outside the classroom window. She could see some of them sitting on the branches of an apple tree. Mrs. Harper checked to see if everyone was present. Each child called out when they heard their name. She then asked for a volunteer to read a story about a family of grasshoppers. Many hands were raised but she picked Josie's friend, Mary. While Mary was reading the story, she got a tickle in her throat. She began to cough. Mrs. Harper told her to go get some water to drink and a boy named Henry finished the story. Next, Mrs. Harper showed the class a butterfly garden. Someone asked if butterflies ate other bugs. Mrs. Harper said that butterflies don't eat but only drink. Josie was chosen to pass out turkey sandwiches for lunch. Mrs. Harper went to the refrigerator. She got out some vanilla yoghurt for each of the boys and girls. All the students cheered.

BAGHDAD, Iraq (CNN) -- The Iraqi man who was jailed after throwing his shoes at then-President George W. Bush last year arrived in Syria on Tuesday night, hours after being released from prison, his employer said. 

Muntadhar al-Zaidi speaks to reporters shorlty after his release from an Iraqi jail. 

Al-Baghdadia TV said Muntadhar al-Zaidi had arrived in Damascus. 

Al-Zaidi's brother, Dhirgham al-Zaidi, told CNN that the 30-year-old journalist was to travel in a private plane to Greece for medical treatment. 

Shortly after he left prison, the 30-year-old journalist visited the studios of his employer, Al-Baghdadia TV, where he spoke to other reporters about his experience. He wore a sash in the colors of the Iraqi national flag draped around his shoulders. 

Muntadhar al-Zaidi said he was beaten with cables and pipes and tortured with electricity immediately after guards removed him from a news conference for hurling both shoes at Bush. He said he was taken into another room and beaten even as the news conference continued. 

However, he remained defiant about the incident that landed him in prison. 

"I got my chance, and I didn't miss it," he said. 

"I am not a hero, and I admit that," he added. "I am a person with a stance. I saw my country burning." 

Al-Zaidi, who was serving a one-year sentence after the jail-throwing incident December 14, was given a "conditional discharge." 

Under Iraqi law, a "conditional discharge" allows for the release of a prisoner after he serves three-quarters of his sentence, on good behavior.

Bob was happy. He was at a new school, and students there were friendly. "Hi, Bob!" some students greeted him, but some students said, "Hi, Peter!" Bob didn't understand. He asked one student. "Why do some students call me Peter?" "Oh, that's easy to answer," the students said, "Peter was a student here last year. Now he is at a different school. You look like Peter. Some students thought that you were Peter." Bob wanted to meet Peter. He got Peter's address from a student and went to Peter's house. Peter opened the door. Bob couldn't believe his eyes. He looked really like Peter! Bob and Peter had the same color eyes and same smile. They had the same black hair. They also had the same birthday. And they both were adopted by two different families. Bob and Peter found out that they were twin brothers. Soon after the boys were born, one family adopted Bob, and another family adopted Peter. Bob's family never knew about Peter, and Peter's family never knew about Bob. Soon Bob and Peter's story appeared in the newspaper. There was a photo of Bob and Peter next to the story. A young man called John saw the photo in the newspaper. John couldn't believe his eyes. He looked like Bob and Peter! He had the same color eyes and the same smile. He had the same black hair. He had the same birthday. And he, too, was adopted by another family. Later John met Bob and Peter. When Bob and Peter saw John, they couldn't believe their eyes. John looked really like them!

(CNN) -- Each year, Grammy Week offers up a full calendar of events -- each one boasting a guest list more spectacular than the next. But this year, the most coveted ticket was Friday night's "2013 MusiCares Person of the Year Tribute" honoring Bruce Springsteen. 

The evening's entertainment featured six Rock and Roll Hall of Famers, a few critically acclaimed young artists -- and The Boss himself. 

Neil Young and Crazy Horse turned up the volume with a spirited version of "Born in the U.S.A," flanked by a pair of cheerleaders with the letter "S" emblazoned on their sweaters. Colombian superstar Juanes put a bilingual spin on "Hungry Heart," singing verses in both Spanish and English, and John Legend transformed "Dancing in the Dark" into a jazzy piano ballad, which led Springsteen to later remark that "he made me sound like Gershwin. I love that." 

Other standout performances included Mumford & Sons' banjo-laced cover of "I'm on Fire," Tom Morello and Jim James' mesmerizing take on "The Ghost of Tom Joad," and country superstar Kenny Chesney's quietly effective rendition of "One Step Up." 

Elton John also opted for simplicity, accompanied only by his piano on "Streets of Philadelphia." But the most curious vocal of the night was on "Lonesome Day," where Sting exhibited a raspy growl that suggested he was looking to honor Springsteen by sounding like him. 

The evening was part all-star concert, part fundraiser to benefit the MusiCares Foundation, the Recording Academy's philanthropic arm that provides assistance to members of the music industry.

Tehran, Iran (CNN) -- A nuclear scientist was killed in a blast in Tehran on Wednesday morning, an Iranian news agency reported, in the latest in a string of attacks that Iran has blamed on Israel. 

A motorcyclist placed a magnetic bomb under Mostafa Ahmadi Roshan's Peugeot 405, the state-run IRNA news agency said. The blast also wounded two others, IRNA said. 

State television channel Press TV reported later Wednesday that Roshan's driver, Reza Qashqaei, had died in a hospital from his injuries. 

Mohammad Khazaee, Iranian ambassador to the United Nations, condemned what he called "cruel, inhumane and criminal acts of terrorism against the Iranian scientists." 

"Based on the existing evidence collected by the relevant Iranian security authorities, similar to previous incidents, perpetrators used the same terrorist method in assassinating Iranian nuclear scientists, i.e., attaching a sticky magnetic bomb to the car carrying the scientists and detonating it," Khazaee said in a statement. 

"I would like to emphasize, once again, that the Islamic Republic (of) Iran would not compromise over its inalienable right to use nuclear energy for peaceful purposes and any kind of political and economic pressures or terrorist attacks targeting the Iranian nuclear scientists, could not prevent our nation in exercising this right," Khazaee said. 

Lawmaker Kazem Jalali blamed the intelligence agencies of the United States and Israel for the latest attack, saying the United Nations' nuclear watchdog, the International Atomic Energy Agency, also bore responsibility for passing on information about Iran's nuclear scientists to other countries, IRNA reports.

CHAPTER XII 

The crowd fell back, leaving a lane down which Walter walked, carrying the apple. There was dead silence as he passed. Then the people began to whisper excitedly to one another. 

"Shall this be done before our eyes?" said Arnold of Melchthal to Werner Stauffacher. "Of what use was it that we swore an oath to rebel if we permit this? Let us rise and slay the tyrant." 

Werner Stauffacher, prudent man, scratched his chin thoughtfully. 

"We-e-ll," he said, "you see, the difficulty is that we are not armed and the soldiers _are_. There is nothing I should enjoy more than slaying the tyrant, only I have an idea that the tyrant would slay us. You see my point?" 

"Why were we so slow!" groaned Arnold. "We should have risen before, and then this would never have happened. Who was it that advised us to delay?" 

"We-e-ll," said Stauffacher (who had himself advised delay), "I can't quite remember at the moment, but I dare say you could find out by looking up the minutes of our last meeting. I know the motion was carried by a majority of two votes. See! Gessler grows impatient." 

Gessler, who had been fidgeting on his horse for some time, now spoke again, urging Tell to hurry. 

"Begin!" he cried--"begin!" 

"Immediately," replied Tell, fitting the arrow to the string. 

Gessler began to mock him once more. 

"You see now," he said, "the danger of carrying arms. I don't know if you have ever noticed it, but arrows very often recoil on the man who carries them. The only man who has any business to possess a weapon is the ruler of a country--myself, for instance. A low, common fellow--if you will excuse the description--like yourself only grows proud through being armed, and so offends those above him. But, of course, it's no business of mine. I am only telling you what I think about it. Personally, I like to encourage my subjects to shoot; that is why I am giving you such a splendid mark to shoot at. You see, Tell?"  [Q:] who itched their chin? [A:] Werner Stauffacher,  [Q:] who is armed? [A:] the soldiers  [Q:] was there an animal present? [A:] yes  [Q:] what animal? [A:] his horse  [Q:] was Walter holding anything? [A:] yes  [Q:] what? [A:] the apple  [Q:] who was going to be slayed? [A:] the tyrant."  [Q:] who recommended the delay? [A:] Stauffacher  [Q:] how many voted for it? [A:] it was carried by a majority of two votes  [Q:] where was it voted upon? [A:] at the last meeting.  [Q:] who held the arrow [A:] Tell  [Q:] did they ever shoot it? [A:] No
Argentina is subdivided into twenty-three provinces (, singular "provincia") and one autonomous city ("ciudad autónoma"), Buenos Aires, which is the federal capital of the nation () as decided by Congress. The provinces and the capital have their own constitutions, but exist under a federal system. 

During the War of Independence the main cities and their surrounding countrysides became provinces though the intervention of their "cabildos". The Anarchy of the Year XX completed this process, shaping the original thirteen provinces. Jujuy seceded from Salta in 1834, and the thirteen provinces became fourteen. After seceding for a decade, Buenos Aires Province accepted the 1853 Constitution of Argentina in 1861, and its capital city was made a federal territory in 1880. 

A law from 1862 designated as national territories those under federal control but outside the frontiers of the provinces. In 1884 they served as bases for the establishment of the governorates of Misiones, Formosa, Chaco, La Pampa, Neuquén, Río Negro, Chubut, Santa Cruz and Tierra del Fuego. The agreement about a frontier dispute with Chile in 1900 created the National Territory of Los Andes; its lands were incorporated into Jujuy, Salta and Catamarca in 1943. La Pampa and Chaco became provinces in 1951. Misiones did so in 1953, and Formosa, Neuquén, Río Negro, Chubut and Santa Cruz, in 1955. The last national territory, Tierra del Fuego, became the Tierra del Fuego, Antártida e Islas del Atlántico Sur Province in 1990. [Q:] what created the National Territory of Los Andes?

There once was a little old lady who had no friends. She rode her bike to and from the store and didn't say hello to anyone along the way. One day she saw a little girl crying in the street. No one else was around to take care of the girl so the little old lady stopped her bike and asked the girl, "What is wrong, Dear?" The little girl said, "I hurt my knee when I fell down!" "Oh dear!" cried the little old lady and bent down and looked at the girl's knee. "It looks to me like you have a scrape," she said. The little girl cried and the little old lady said, "Don't worry, all boo-boos hurt a little but it's the medicine that makes it go away." The little old lady bent down and blew on the girl's knee and whispered, "Go away, go away, no boo-boos here today!" The little girl smiled and that little old lady found her first friend.

Steven Spielberg was not a scholar, and his classmates teased him. Rather than read, the kid really preferred running around with an 8mm camera, shooting homemade movies, which he showed to friends for a small fee. 

In his first year of high school, he dropped out. But when his parents persuaded him to return, he was mistakenly placed in a learningdisabled class, which lasted one month. Only when the family moved to another town did he land up in a more suitable high school, where he eventually graduated. 

After being denied entrance into a traditional filmmaking school, Steven Spielherg enrolled in English at California State University at Long Beach. Then in 1965, he recalls, in one of those serendipitous moments, his life took a complete turn. Visiting Universal Studios, he met Chuck Silvers, an executive in the editorial department. Silvers liked the kid who made 8mm films and invited him back sometime to visit. 

He appeared the next day. Spielberg, dressed in a dark suit, carrying his father's briefcase with nothing inside but a sandwich and candy bars walked confidently up to the guard at the gate of Universal and gave him a casual wave. The guard waved back. He was in. 

"For the entire summer," Spielberg remembers, "I dressed in my suit and hung out with the directors and writers, including Silvers, who knew the kid wasn't a studio employee, but winked at him. I even found an office that wasn't being used, and became a squatter . I bought some plastic tiles and put my name in the building directory: Steven Spielberg, Room 23C." 

It paid off for everyone. Ten years later, the 28yearold Spielberg directed Jaws, which took in $470 million, then the biggest grossing movie of all time. Dozens of films and awards have followed because Steven Spielberg knew what his teachers didn't--talent is in the eyes of the filmmaker.

Most people know precious gemstones by their appearances. An emerald flashes deep green, a ruby seems to hold a red fire inside, and a diamond shines like a star. It's more difficult to tell where the gem was mined, since a diamond from Australia or Arkansas may appear the same to one from the Democratic Republic of the Congo. However, recently, a team of scientists has found a way to identify a gemstone's origin. 

Beneath the surface of a gemstone, on the tiny level of atoms and molecules , lie clues to its origin. At this year's meeting of the Geological Society of America in Minneapolis, Catherine McManus reported on a technique that uses lasers to clarify these clues and identify a stone's homeland. McManus directs scientific research at Materialytics, in Killeen, Texas. The company is developing the technique. "With enough data, we could identify which country, which mining place, even the individual mine a gemstone comes from," McManus told Science News. 

Some gemstones, including many diamonds, come from war-torn countries. Sales of those "blood minerals" may encourage violent civil wars where innocent people are injured or killed. In an effort to reduce the trade in blood minerals, the U.S. government passed law in July 2010 that requires companies that sell gemstones to determine the origins of their stones. 

To figure out where gemstones come from, McManus and her team focus a powerful laser on a small sample of the gemstone. The technique is called laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy. Just as heat can turn ice into water or water into steam, energy from the laser changes the state of matter of the stone. The laser changes a miniscule part of the gemstone into plasma, a gas state of matter in which tiny particles called electrons separate from atoms. 

The plasma, which is superhot, produces a light pattern. (The science of analyzing this kind of light pattern is called spectroscopy.) Different elements produce different patterns, but McManus and her team say that gemstones from the same area produce similar patterns. Materialytics has already collected patterns from thousands of gemstones, including more than 200 from diamonds. They can compare the light pattern from an unknown gemstone to patterns they do know and look for a match. The light pattern acts like a signature, telling the researchers the origin of the gemstone. 

In a small test, the laser technique correctly identified the origins of 95 out of every 100 diamonds. For gemstones like emeralds and rubies, the technique proved successful for 98 out of every 100 stones. The scientists need to collect and analyze more samples, including those from war-torn countries, before the tool is ready for commercial use. 

Scientists like Barbara Dutrow, a mineralogist from Louisiana State University in Baton Rouge, find the technique exciting. "This is a basic new tool that could provide a better fingerprint of a material from a particular locality," she told Science News.

Jenny loves singing. But her baby sister is crying so loud that Jenny can't hear herself, so she was angry! Her Mom said she could try to play with her sister, but that only made her baby sister cry louder. Jenny tried to ask the baby to stop crying, but that didn't work. Jenny was getting tired, but she had an idea. She would give her baby sister one of her toy horses. The baby loved horses! The baby played with the horse, but then she started crying again. This made Jenny sad. She wanted to sing! Then she had a great idea. She would give the baby a pacifier! This worked. The baby stopped crying and Jenny started singing. Everyone was so happy! [Q:] Who loves singing? [A:] Jenny.  [Q:] How is she feeling? [A:] Angry.  [Q:] Why? [A:] Because her baby sister is crying so loud that Jenny can't hear herself.

A boy named Eduardo in a far away place is thinking about a girl he loves. 

He is cold. It is snowing where he lives. He lives in Argentina. 

It's warm where she lives in Hawaii. She eats fresh fruit. Her shower is outdoors under the warm sun as red birds fly around her. It is nice, but she misses him. 

She remembers he is very pretty. She wondered if he would really love her always, because she is older. 

He didn't care. Eduardo was poor, so he could not visit her. 

Maybe a time machine would help!! She can give back her birthdays! But she didn't want to bring back any dinosaurs back by accident. Like last time. 

Then an angel flew down from a star called the Pleiades to help her. His name was Eh. He said, "close your eyes! Then remember the most happy you have ever felt! Let go of any thing that feels like clouds. Imagine puppies hugging you, and kitties purring with you. Imagine you are eating chocolate ice cream! 

As long as you remember how to be happy you can ALWAYS be as young as Eduardo! And you can think of GREAT ways you can see him again!" 

It worked! She had an idea. Someone in a place called MR was buying stories that people wrote. She wrote one about her & Eduardo! 

It paid for her airplane ride. Wow. 

Then they were together again. Hugging each other in happiness, they said, "Thank you everyone, for helping us!" [Q:] Who lives in Argentina? [A:] Eduardo  [Q:] What kind of weather did they have in Argentina? [A:] cold and snowing  [Q:] Does he love somebody? [A:] a girl  [Q:] Where does the girl live? [A:] Hawaii.

Tom had to fix some things around the house. He had to fix the door. He had to fix the window. But before he did anything he had to fix the toilet. Tom called over his best friend Jim to help him. Jim brought with him his friends Molly and Holly. Tom thought that Jim was going to bring Dolly with him but he didn't. The four of them got to work right away. Fixing the toilet was easy. Fixing the door was also easy but fixing the window was very hard. The window was stuck and could not be opened. They all pushed on the window really hard until finally it opened. Once the window was fixed the four of them made a delicious dinner and talked about all of the good work that they had done. Tom was glad that he had such good friends to help him with his work.

Telephone numbers in the United Kingdom are administered by the UK government's Office of Communications (Ofcom). For this purpose Ofcom established a telephone numbering plan, known as the "National Telephone Numbering Plan", which is the system for assigning telephone numbers to subscriber stations. Since 28 April 2001, almost all geographic numbers and most non-geographic numbers have 9 or 10 national (significant) numbers after the "0" trunk code. All mobile telephone numbers have 10 national (significant) numbers after the "0" trunk code. The overall structure of the UK's National Numbering Plan is: A short sample of geographic numbers, set out in the officially approved (Ofcom) number groups: In the United Kingdom, area codes are two, three, four, or, rarely, five digits long (after the initial zero). Regions with shorter area codes, typically large cities, permit the allocation of more telephone numbers as the local number portion has more digits. Local customer numbers are four to eight figures long. The total number of digits is ten, but in a very few areas the total may be nine digits (after the initial zero). The "area code" is also referred to as an "STD (code)" (subscriber trunk dialling) or a "dialling code" in the UK. [Q:] Who is responsible for phone numbers in the UK? [A:] the UK government's Office of Communications  [Q:] How is  the office's name abbreviated? [A:] Ofcom  [Q:] What did they establish to assign numbers?

CHAPTER V 

AT OAK HALL ONCE MORE 

"Hurrah! here we are at Oakdale at last!" 

"Old town looks natural, doesn't it?" 

"So it does, Roger. See any of the fellows?" 

"Not yet, Dave. But we are sure to meet somebody, even if it is a school-day," went on the senator's son. 

"Uncle Dunston, let me take the auto around to the hotel," said our hero. "I know the streets better than you do. We have to make several turns." 

"All right, Dave," was the ready answer, and Dunston Porter arose and allowed his nephew to crowd into the driver's seat. 

The run to the town in the vicinity of which Oak Hall was located had been made without further incident. On the way the party had talked over Mrs. Breen's affairs, and Dunston Porter had promised to take the matter up, through his lawyer. 

"I think it best that our names don't appear in the case," said he. "Otherwise, Mr. Haskers might not treat you so well during the term." 

"He never treats us well, anyway," grumbled Phil. "But you are right, don't mention our names." 

On this late winter day the town looked rather dreary, but the young folks were in high spirits, and Dave, with a grand flourish, ran the car up to one of the best hotels the place afforded. As before, word had been sent ahead that they were coming, and the host of the resort came out to meet them. 

"We'll have dinner ready inside of quarter of an hour," he said. "Come in and make yourselves at home."  [Q:] Where are they? [A:] at Oakdale  [Q:] Are they excited? [A:] yes  [Q:] Who are they looking for? [A:] the fellows  [Q:] Do they see them? [A:] no  [Q:] Where do they want to take the car? [A:] to the hotel  [Q:] Who does he ask this? [A:] Uncle Dunston  [Q:] Why? [A:] Because Dave knew the streets better  [Q:] Is it a straight drive? [A:] no  [Q:] Do they switch seats? [A:] yes  [Q:] How did the drive go? [A:] without further incident
A National Olympic Committee (NOC) is a national constituent of the worldwide Olympic movement. Subject to the controls of the International Olympic Committee, NOCs are responsible for organizing their people's participation in the Olympic Games. They may nominate cities within their respective areas as candidates for future Olympic Games. NOCs also promote the development of athletes and training of coaches and officials at a national level within their geographies. 

As of 2016, there are 206 NOCs: Each of the 193 member states of the United Nations; United Nations observer state Palestine; the Cook Islands, a state in free association with New Zealand whose capacity to participate in international organizations has been recognized by the United Nations Secretariat; and two states with limited recognition, Kosovo and Taiwan (designated as "Chinese Taipei" by the IOC). 

There are also nine dependent territories with NOCs: 

Prior to 1996, rules for recognising separate countries within the IOC were not as strict as those within the United Nations, which allowed these territories to field teams separately from their sovereign state. Following an amendment to the Olympic Charter in 1996, NOC recognition can only be granted after recognition as an independent state by the international community. Since the rule does not apply retroactively, the dependent territories which were recognised before the rule change are allowed to continue sending separate teams to the Olympics, while the Faroe Islands and Macau send their own Paralympic teams. [Q:] How many NOCs were there in 2016? [A:] 206  [Q:] What does NOC stand for? [A:] National Olympic Committee  [Q:] So is there only one NOC per nation? [A:] unknown  [Q:] Can you name two NOCs?

[A:] International Olympic Committee  [Q:] How many dependent territories have NOCs? [A:] nine  [Q:] Was there an amendment to the Olympic Charter? [A:] Yes  [Q:] When? [A:] 1996  [Q:] Was it good retroactively? [A:] no  [Q:] Did it have to do with recognition as an independent state? [A:] Yes  [Q:] Could those 9 dependent territories keep participating? [A:] Yes  [Q:] What kind of team does the Faroe Islands send? [A:] Paralympic  [Q:] What kind of team does Macau send? [A:] Paralympic  [Q:] How many member states does the Uniter Nations have? [A:] 193  [Q:] Can you name a United Nations observer state? [A:] Palestine  [Q:] Do the Cook Islands have something to do with New Zealand? [A:] Yes  [Q:] What's another name for Taiwan? [A:] Chinese Taipei
We were standing at the top of a church not far from my home. I didn't know why. "Look down," Father said. I tried and saw the square in the center of the village. And I saw the streets to the square. "See, Elsa," Father said. "There is more than one way to the square. If you can't get where you want to go by one road, try another." Earlier that day, I asked Mother to do something about what we had for lunch at school. But she didn't think the food was as bad as I said. When I turned to Father for help, he brought me to the church. At school the next day, I filled a bottle with the soup for our lunch and took it home. I told the cook to pour the soup in a plate and bring it to Mother. She drank it and cried out, "What's the matter with the soup today?" I at once told her what I had done , and Mother said that she would take up the matter of lunches at school the next day . Now I really understood why Father had taken me to the church. I began to work as a fashion designer two years ago. I wouldn't stop working until I tried every way to my goal. [Q:] Where were we standing? [A:] at the top of a church  [Q:] Why? [A:] unknown  [Q:] What is my name? [A:] Elsa  [Q:] What did I ask my mom to do? [A:] to do something about  lunch at school.  [Q:] What did I put in the bottle?

[A:] take up the matter of lunch  [Q:] What is my profession? [A:] a fashion designer  [Q:] For how long? [A:] two years  [Q:] What did I learn? [A:] why Father had taken her to the church.
CHAPTER XI Peter Rabbit and Jerry Muskrat Are Puzzled. 

Jerry Muskrat was more and more sure that his big cousin, Paddy the Beaver, didn't know quite so much as he might about house-building. Jerry would have liked to offer some suggestions, but he didn't quite dare. You see, he was very anxious not to displease his big cousin. But he felt that he simply had got to speak his mind to someone, so he swam across to where he had seen Peter Rabbit almost every night since Paddy began to build. Sure enough, Peter was there, sitting up very straight and staring with big round eyes at the platform of mud and sticks out in the water where Paddy the Beaver was at work. 

"Well, Peter, what do you think of it?" asked Jerry 

"What is it?" asked Peter innocently. "Is it another dam?" 

Jerry threw back his head and laughed and laughed. 

Peter looked at him suspiciously. "I don't see anything to laugh at," said he. 

"Why, it's a house, you stupid. It's Paddy's new house," replied Jerry, wiping the tears of laughter from his eyes. 

"I'm not stupid!" retorted Peter. "How was I to know that that pile of mud and sticks is meant for a house? It certainly doesn't look it. Where is the door?" 

"To tell you the truth, I don't think it is much of a house myself," replied Jerry. "It has got a door, all right. In fact it has got three. You can't see them because they are under water, and there is a passage from each right up through that platform of mud and sticks, which is the foundation of the house. It really is a very fine foundation, Peter; it really is. But what I can't understand is what Paddy is thinking of by building that great pile of mud right in the middle. When he gets his walls built, where will his bedroom be? There won't be any room at all. It won't be a house at all--just a big useless pile of sticks and mud.  [Q:] Who was laughing a bunch? [A:] Jerry  [Q:] Who was annoyed by it? [A:] Peter  [Q:] What were they talking of at that moment? [A:] Paddy's new house  [Q:] What did the annoyed boy this is was at first? [A:] Another dam  [Q:] Was the laughing boy polite about the misunderstanding? [A:] No  [Q:] What did he call him? [A:] Stupid  [Q:] Why didn't the annoyed boy believe it wasn't a home? [A:] It  doesn't look it  [Q:] What's missing? [A:] the door  [Q:] How many does the laughing boy point out there actually are? [A:] Three  [Q:] Why can't they be easily noticed? [A:] because they are under water  [Q:] What is the base made of? [A:] mud and sticks  [Q:] Is the builder related to anyone? [A:] Yes  [Q:] Who? [A:] Jerry Muskrat  [Q:] Does he say his critiques to the builder? [A:] No  [Q:] Why not? [A:] He was anxious not to displease his big cousin  [Q:] Who had been there watching most of the process? [A:] Peter Rabbit  [Q:] Was he slouching? [A:] No  [Q:] What was his posture then? [A:] sitting up very straight  [Q:] What living space will the builder have trouble adding? [A:] his bedroom  [Q:] Why? [A:] There won't be any room
The critical moment for Sen. Ted Cruz and his allies came around 7 p.m. on Tuesday night. 

The Texas Republican's suit was still crisp, despite more than four hours into what would become a rhetorical marathon of more than 21 hours on the Senate floor aimed at derailing Obamacare. 

But until that point, the brunt of the speaking had been done by Cruz and his ally, Sen. Mike Lee, R-Utah. Without more help, Lee's aides weren't sure how long the effort could continue. 

Then Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Florida, arrived. It was a sign that they'd get the bodies they needed for the long haul. 

"When he showed up, we had a feeling that we could go until noon (the next day)," said Lee spokesman Brian Phillips. 

Lee was on or near the floor all night. Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky, who held the floor for 12 hours in March, jumped in. Even ideological opponent Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Illinois, shouldered some speaking time while trying to refute Cruz' points. 

That gave Cruz some time for mental breaks even though he couldn't leave the floor to eat, use the restroom or do anything else. 

For material, staff pulled together binders of articles, talking points and documents that could be used to fill time. And as social networks heated up, aides ferried in a stream of tweets for Cruz to read. 

But to the big and less comfortable question: How did he manage physically? 

Good, pliable shoes, for a start. Cruz left his trademark Ostrich boots behind and told the chamber that he picked up some sneakers in preparation for the long hours of standing.

CHAPTER XIII. ST. VALENTINE'S DAY 



Miss Mohun came back in the dark after a long day, for once in her life quite jaded, and explaining that the health-officer and the landlord had been by no means agreed, and that nothing could be done till Sir Jasper came home and decided whether to retain the house or not. 

All that she was clear about, and which she had telegraphed to Aden, was, that there must be no going back to Silverfold for the present, and she was prepared to begin lodging-hunting as soon as she received an answer. 

'And how have you got on?' she asked, thinking all looked rather blank. 

'We haven't been to see Fly,' broke out Valetta, 'though she went out on the beach, and Mysie must not stay out after dark, for fear she should cough.' 

'Mysie says they are afraid of excitement,' said Gillian gloomily. 

'Then you have seen nothing of the others?' 

'Yes, I have seen Victoria, said Aunt Adeline, with a meaning smile. 

Miss Mohun went up to take off her things, and Gillian followed her, shutting the door with ominous carefulness, and colouring all over. 

'Aunt Jane, I ought to tell you. A dreadful thing has happened!' 

'Indeed, my dear! What?' 

'I have had a valentine.' 

'Oh!' repressing a certain inclination to laugh at the bathos from the look of horror and shame in the girl's eyes. 

'It is from that miserable Alexis! Oh, I know I brought it on myself, and I have been so wretched and so ashamed all day.'  [Q:] He returned after dark? [A:] yes  [Q:] Who returned after dark?

History is full of examples of leaders joining together to meet common goals. But rarely have two leaders worked together with such friendship and cooperation as American President Franklin Roosevelt and British Prime Minister Winston Churchill. They both were born in wealthy families and were active in politics for many years. Both men loved the sea and the navy,history and nature. 

Roosevelt and Churchill first met when they were lowerlevel officials in World War One. But neither man remembered much about that meeting. However,as they worked together during the Second World War they came to like and trust each other. Roosevelt and Churchill exchanged more than one thousand seven hundred letters and messages during five and a half years. They met many times,at large national gatherings and in private talks. But the closeness of their friendship might be seen best in a story told by one of Roosevelt's close advisors,Harry Hopkins. Hopkins remembered how Churchill was visiting Roosevelt at the White House one day. Roosevelt went into Churchill's room in the morning to say hello. But the president was shocked to see Churchill coming from the washing room with no clothes at all. Roosevelt immediately apologized to the British leader for seeing him naked. But Churchill reportedly said: "The Prime Minister of Great Britain has nothing to hide from the president of the United States." And then both men laughed. 

The United States and Great Britain were only two of several nations that joined together in the war to resist Hitler and his Allies. In January,1942,twentysix of these nations signed an agreement promising to fight for peace,religious freedom,human rights,and justice. The three major Allies,however,were the most important for the war effort: the United States,Britain,and the Soviet Union. Yet,Churchill and Roosevelt disagreed about when to attack Hitler in western Europe. And Churchill resisted Roosevelt's suggestions that Britain give up some of its colonies. But in general,the friendship between Roosevelt and Churchill,and between the United States and Britain led the two nations to cooperate closely. [Q:] Which two leaders worked together?

Buddhism /ˈbudɪzəm/ is a nontheistic religion[note 1] or philosophy (Sanskrit: धर्म dharma; Pali: धम्म dhamma) that encompasses a variety of traditions, beliefs and spiritual practices largely based on teachings attributed to Gautama Buddha, commonly known as the Buddha ("the awakened one"). According to Buddhist tradition, the Buddha lived and taught in the eastern part of the Indian subcontinent, present-day Nepal sometime between the 6th and 4th centuries BCE.[note 1] He is recognized by Buddhists as an awakened or enlightened teacher who shared his insights to help sentient beings end their suffering through the elimination of ignorance and craving. Buddhists believe that this is accomplished through the direct understanding and perception of dependent origination and the Four Noble Truths. 

Two major extant branches of Buddhism are generally recognized by scholars: Theravada ("The School of the Elders") and Mahayana ("The Great Vehicle"). Vajrayana, a body of teachings attributed to Indian siddhas, may be viewed as a third branch or merely a part of Mahayana. Theravada has a widespread following in Sri Lanka and Southeast Asia. Mahayana which includes the traditions of Pure Land, Zen, Nichiren Buddhism, Shingon, and Tiantai (Tendai) is found throughout East Asia. Tibetan Buddhism, which preserves the Vajrayana teachings of eighth century India, is practiced in regions surrounding the Himalayas, Mongolia and Kalmykia. Buddhists number between an estimated 488 million[web 1] and 535 million, making it one of the world's major religions. [Q:] How many Buddhists are there estimated to be? [A:] Between 488 million and 535 million.  [Q:] What is Buddhism? [A:] A religion.  [Q:] Who is it attributed to? [A:] Guatama Buddha  [Q:] What is another name for Buddha? [A:] The awakened one.

CHAPTER XXX. HOW THE BRUSHWOOD MEN CAME TO THE CHATEAU OF VILLEFRANCHE. 

It was late ere Alleyne Edricson, having carried Sir Nigel the goblet of spiced wine which it was his custom to drink after the curling of his hair, was able at last to seek his chamber. It was a stone-flagged room upon the second floor, with a bed in a recess for him, and two smaller pallets on the other side, on which Aylward and Hordle John were already snoring. Alleyne had knelt down to his evening orisons, when there came a tap at his door, and Ford entered with a small lamp in his hand. His face was deadly pale, and his hand shook until the shadows flickered up and down the wall. 

"What is it, Ford?" cried Alleyne, springing to his feet. 

"I can scarce tell you," said he, sitting down on the side of the couch, and resting his chin upon his hand. "I know not what to say or what to think." 

"Has aught befallen you, then?" 

"Yes, or I have been slave to my own fancy. I tell you, lad, that I am all undone, like a fretted bow-string. Hark hither, Alleyne! it cannot be that you have forgotten little Tita, the daughter of the old glass-stainer at Bordeaux?" 

"I remember her well." 

"She and I, Alleyne, broke the lucky groat together ere we parted, and she wears my ring upon her finger. 'Caro mio,' quoth she when last we parted, 'I shall be near thee in the wars, and thy danger will be my danger.' Alleyne, as God is my help, as I came up the stairs this night I saw her stand before me, her face in tears, her hands out as though in warning--I saw it, Alleyne, even as I see those two archers upon their couches. Our very finger-tips seemed to meet, ere she thinned away like a mist in the sunshine."  [Q:] Did Alleyene seek his chamber early? [A:] No  [Q:] What did he have to do first? [A:] serve wine  [Q:] To who? [A:] Sir Nigel  [Q:] Where was his room? [A:] On the 2nd floor  [Q:] Did he share it? [A:] Yes  [Q:] with how many others? [A:] 2 people  [Q:] Who cam in after him? [A:] Ford  [Q:] Was he calm? [A:] No  [Q:] Who is his betrothed? [A:] Tita  [Q:] Is she here? [A:] In some form, perhaps  [Q:] Where? [A:] Upon the stairs  [Q:] Why did he see her? [A:] unknown  [Q:] Who is her father? [A:] the old glass-stainer  [Q:] Did he think she was trying to warn him of something? [A:] Yes  [Q:] Where was he sitting? [A:] on the side of the couch  [Q:] Was she crying? [A:] Yes
The Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic (Russian SFSR or RSFSR; Russian: Российская Советская Федеративная Социалистическая Республика, tr. Rossiyskaya Sovetskaya Federativnaya Sotsialisticheskaya Respublika listen (help·info)) commonly referred to as Soviet Russia or simply as Russia, was a sovereign state in 1917–22, the largest, most populous, and most economically developed republic of the Soviet Union in 1922–91 and a sovereign part of the Soviet Union with its own legislation in 1990–91. The Republic comprised sixteen autonomous republics, five autonomous oblasts, ten autonomous okrugs, six krais, and forty oblasts. Russians formed the largest ethnic group. To the west it bordered Finland, Norway and Poland; and to the south, China, Mongolia and North Korea whilst bordering the Arctic Ocean to the north, the Pacific Ocean to the east and the Black sea and Caspian Sea to the south. Within the USSR, it bordered the Baltic republics (Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia), the Byelorussian SSR and the Ukrainian SSR to the west. To the south it bordered the Georgian, Azerbaijan and Kazakh SSRs. [Q:] what is commonly referred to as Soviet Russia ? [A:] Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic  [Q:] what kind of state was it ? [A:] sovereign  [Q:] was if from 1817-22 ? [A:] yes  [Q:] was it a small poor state ?

At night, the magical chipmunks come out to play in the woods. They shower in bowls, and take pictures with their phones. They brush their teeth until they twinkle. They hide in the bushes and play games. There is one game they really like. To play, one chipmunk puts his ear on the phone, and another hides in the woods with a different phone. One chipmunk walks through the woods looking for the hiding chipmunk. The hiding chipmunk tells 'hot' or 'cold' to the first one on the phone. If 'hot', he is very close to finding! If 'cold', he's very far away! Chipmunks love to be hot, so there is a twist to this game! These magical chipmunks can change the temperature with their voice, so if the hiding chipmunk says cold, all the chipmunks becomes colder. If the hiding chipmunk says 'hot', all the chipmunks become hotter. Oh, how the chipmunks love to play this game! But they don't like to lose! [Q:] What comes out at night? [A:] Chipmunks  [Q:] What do they bathe in? [A:] Bowls  [Q:] How do they tell when their teeth are clean? [A:] Until they twinkle.  [Q:] How do they control the temp? [A:] With their voice.  [Q:] What do they use to play the game? [A:] A phone.  [Q:] how many? [A:] Two.  [Q:] Do they hate the game? [A:] No.  [Q:] what is special about the critters? [A:] They are magical!  [Q:] what else do they do with the phones? [A:] Take pictures.  [Q:] where do they hide? [A:] In bushes.
(CNN) -- Iran's vital oil industry appears to be the latest front in a power struggle between President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad and Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei -- a fight that overseas analysts say the colorful president appears to be losing. 

Ahmadinejad is trying to retain control of Iran's Oil Ministry despite a ruling by the country's top judicial body that he can't serve as its acting chief. It's the latest in a series of unusually public squabbles between Ahmadinejad and allies of Khamenei, the Islamic republic's clerical leader, in recent weeks. 

Khamenei backed Ahmadinejad through the tumult that followed his hotly disputed 2009 re-election, urging Iranians to accept the results of the balloting when protesters in the streets declared it a fraud. He presided over a crackdown on the demonstrations, during which security forces were unleashed on crowds and activists were prosecuted and jailed. 

But elements throughout the government have moved to check Ahmadinejad's efforts to replace top officials and have gone after the president's closest advisers, U.S. analyst Alireza Nader told CNN. 

"I think it's a symptom of the general dissatisfaction with President Ahmadinejad that his powers and movement are being curtailed by the various power centers in Iran," said Nader, an expert on Iranian politics at the RAND Corp., an American think tank. 

The outspoken Ahmadinejad has long been a lightning rod for Iran's critics. But Haleh Esfandiari, director of Middle Eastern studies at the Woodrow Wilson International Center, said he may be left a "lame duck" after butting heads with Khamenei.  [Q:] Where does Nader work? [A:] RAND Corp  [Q:] What is his title? [A:] U.S. analyst  [Q:] Does he believe the people are satisfied with President Ahmadinejad? [A:] no  [Q:] What is President Ahmadinejad doing? [A:] trying to retain control of Iran's Oil Ministry  [Q:] Why shouldn't he be doing that? [A:] a ruling by the country's top judicial body  [Q:] Stating what? [A:] he can't serve as its acting chief  [Q:] Why not? [A:] unknown  [Q:] Who is he in a power struggle with? [A:] Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei  [Q:] Is he winning? [A:] yes  [Q:] Has this been a private battle? [A:] no  [Q:] Who is Khamenei? [A:] Supreme Leader  [Q:] What does Haleh Esfandiari think about the situation? [A:] Ahmadinejad may be left a "lame duck"  [Q:] What does Haleh Esfandiari do? [A:] director of Middle Eastern studies  [Q:] Where?

(CNN) -- Who is Stanislas Cordova? That's the burning question at the heart of "Night Film," the anticipated follow-up to best-selling author Marisha Pessl's 2006 literary debut. 

Pessl burst onto the scene in 2006 with "Special Topics in Calamity Physics." She received a six-figure advance, almost unheard of for a first-time author, a ton of hype and even some snarky backlash over her photogenic looks. But the book lived up to expectations, selling some 200,000 copies and landing on The New York Times' list of Best Books of 2006. 

Seven years later, "Night Film" is hitting bookstores this week amid greater expectations and even more hype. Movie rights are already spoken for by Chernin Entertainment, the studio behind "Oblivion" and "Dawn of the Planet of the Apes," and critics are raving about Pessl's multimedia storytelling approach, which takes readers beyond the novel's pages to explore the story of a mysterious director and the washed-up reporter out to expose him. 

Pessl's fictional mash-up of Stanley Kubrick, Roman Polanski and David Lynch hasn't been seen in public for 30 years. His movies are so frightening no theater will show them; his cult of fans meet in abandoned buildings and underground tunnels for secret screenings. 

Investigative journalist Scott McGrath tried to expose Cordova years ago and it backfired, costing him his job, marriage and reputation. When Cordova's daughter turns up dead in an apparent suicide, McGrath sees an opportunity to exact revenge against the man he blames for his downfall. 

Pessl weaves into the narrative excerpts from magazine articles, newspaper headlines, police reports, crime scene photos and screen shots of online message boards. She also wrote and directed several short films being featured over the next few weeks on YouTube that offer clues into the book's mystery, including snippets and trailers from Cordova's films.  [Q:] What is the book which is looked forward to coming out? [A:] Night Film  [Q:] What about in 2006, what book came out? [A:] Special Topics in Calamity Physics  [Q:] Who was the writer?

[A:] yes  [Q:] How many books had she written before this one? [A:] none. This was the first one  [Q:] How much was she paid to start?

(CNN) -- Pablo Sandoval's record-tying three home runs led the San Francisco Giants to an 8-3 victory over the Detroit Tigers in Game 1 of the World Series. 

Barry Zito gave up just one run in 5 2/3 innings to earn the win for San Francisco. He also had a run-scoring single in the fourth inning. 

Tigers pitching ace Justin Verlander only managed to go four innings, allowing five runs on six hits. 

Sandoval, who had 12 home runs during the regular season, hit a solo home run in the first and a two-run shot in the third off Verlander. In the fifth, he added another home run off Al Alburquerque. He has six home runs in the postseason. 

"In this situation you're going to face the best. For me I just go in there and don't thinking too much or try to do too much, get a pitch you can hit, take advantage of the mistakes he be making. That's a part of my game." Sandoval said. 

His manager said Sandoval has been swinging the bat well for weeks. 

"He's been locked in for a while, and the home runs, really where he hit them, too, it's not easy to hit them where he hit them," Giants skipper Bruce Bochy said. 

Three other players have homered three times in one World Series game. 

Babe Ruth did it twice, and Reggie Jackson also achieved the feat. Last year, St. Louis Cardinals slugger Albert Pujols had three home runs in Game 3.  [Q:] who had 3 home runs ?

CHAPTER II 

THE APARTMENT-HOUSE MYSTERY 

1. 

"This habit of becoming late for breakfast," Lady Ashleigh remarked, as she set down the coffee-pot, "is growing upon your father." 

Ella glanced up from a pile of correspondence through which she had been looking a little negligently. 

"When he comes," she said, "I shall tell him what Clyde says in his new play--that unpunctuality for breakfast and overpunctuality for dinner are two of the signs of advancing age." 

"I shouldn't," her mother advised. "He hates anything that sounds like an epigram, and I noticed that he avoided any allusion to his birthday last month. Any news, dear?" 

"None at all, mother. My correspondence is just the usual sort of rubbish--invitations and gossip. Such a lot of invitations, by-the-bye." 

"At your age," Lady Ashleigh declared, "that is the sort of correspondence which you should find interesting." 

Ella shook her head. She was a very beautiful young woman, but her expression was a little more serious than her twenty-two years warranted. 

"You know I am not like that, mother," she protested. "I have found one thing in life which interests me more than all this frivolous business of amusing oneself. I shall never be happy--not really happy--until I have settled down to study hard. My music is really the only part of life which absolutely appeals to me." 

Lady Ashleigh sighed. 

"It seems so unnecessary," she murmured. "Since Esther was married you are practically an only daughter, you are quite well off, and there are so many young men who want to marry you."  [Q:] WHat is this passage talking about? [A:] unknown  [Q:] Who has a habit of becoming late for breakfast? [A:] the father  [Q:] How old was Ella? [A:] twenty-two years  [Q:] Does she have an older sibling? [A:] unknown  [Q:] What was the name? [A:] Esther  [Q:] Who is the mother? [A:] Lady Ashleigh  [Q:] What amused Ella? [A:] her music  [Q:] Did the mother think it was unneccessary? [A:] Yes  [Q:] What are the two signs of advancing age as mentioned in Clyde's play? [A:] unpunctuality for breakfast and overpunctuality for dinner  [Q:] Are there many men who want to marry Ella? [A:] Yes
Sanskrit (/ˈsænskrɪt/; Sanskrit: saṃskṛtam [səmskr̩t̪əm] or saṃskṛta, originally saṃskṛtā vāk, "refined speech") is the primary sacred language of Hinduism, a philosophical language in Buddhism, Hinduism, Sikhism and Jainism, and a literary language that was in use as a lingua franca in Greater India. It is a standardised dialect of Old Indo-Aryan, originating as Vedic Sanskrit and tracing its linguistic ancestry back to Proto-Indo-Iranian and Proto-Indo-European. Today it is listed as one of the 22 scheduled languages of India and is an official language of the state of Uttarakhand. As one of the oldest Indo-European languages for which substantial written documentation exists, Sanskrit holds a prominent position in Indo-European studies. 

Over 90 weeklies, fortnightlies and quarterlies are published in Sanskrit. Sudharma, a daily newspaper in Sanskrit, has been published out of Mysore, India, since 1970, while Sanskrit Vartman Patram and Vishwasya Vrittantam started in Gujarat during the last five years. Since 1974, there has been a short daily news broadcast on state-run All India Radio. These broadcasts are also made available on the internet on AIR's website. Sanskrit news is broadcast on TV and on the internet through the DD National channel at 6:55 AM IST. [Q:] How many official languages does India have?

One morning, I woke up and went downstairs for breakfast. I fixed my normal breakfast: hot pickles, marshmallows, and ketchup. First I heat up the pickles on the stove, then I put the marshmallows in the toaster as I pour out my small plate of ketchup. Delicious! I eat it every morning, often with a tall glass of lemonade. 

I sat down at the table to eat, and looked out the window at the birds in my yard. Sometimes I see skunks outside, and once I saw a small pot-bellied pig. But today there were only a few flamingos. I opened up the book I was reading, "All About Birds." I had finished the chapter on pigeons, and was moving on to robins. 

While putting ketchup on my marshmallows, I felt something tickling my neck. I looked down, and there was a daddy long-legs, climbing up! I had never seen one so close to my face. 

"Er, what's up?" I asked. 

"Not much," he said. "I smelled the hot pickles, and wanted to have a taste." 

"Sure, little guy," I said. I put a small piece of pickle on my finger and held it out. While I was doing that, that sneaky daddy-long-legs ran down my arm. He grabbed the rest of my pickle, and ran out the door! And that was the last time I gave a pickle to a spider at breakfast. [Q:] What happened one morning? [A:] woke up, went down for breakfast  [Q:] Was it special? [A:] No  [Q:] What was it? [A:] hot pickles, marshmallows, and ketchup  [Q:] Was it good? [A:] Yes  [Q:] Where does he eat it?

(CNN) -- Shiping Bao, the medical examiner who changed his mind on crucial aspects during his testimony at George Zimmerman's trial, has been fired. 

But he's not going down without a fight. 

Bao has hired a lawyer and is hinting at a lawsuit. 

Bao was let go from his job as the associate medical examiner for the Volusia County, Florida, Medical Examiner's Office last week, officials said Wednesday. 

Authorities provided a copy of his termination letter, but did not specify a reason. The letter says Bao was given a choice to resign. He didn't. So, he was terminated Friday. 

Bao's lawyer filed a complaint against the county, CNN affiliate Central Florida News 13 reported. 

The letter reads in part: 

"This is a formal request to ask you to preserve any and all documents...and/or evidence related to Dr. Bao's claims and/or the Trayvon Martin Case." 

Bao performed Trayvon Martin's autopsy after Zimmerman shot dead the 17-year-old on February 26, 2012. 

During Zimmerman's trial, Bao's testimony stood out. 

He changed his mind on important aspects of the case, such as how long Martin survived after he was shot, whether he could have moved afterward and if the marijuana in his system affected his judgment. 

Bao's attorney, Willie E. Gary, said he plans to file a lawsuit for discrimination, job harassment and wrongful termination, the Miami Herald reported. 

George Zimmerman won't be charged for alleged domestic incident

I like to go to the park that is next to the hotel. The park is very big and has lots of ladders and slides. My favorite thing to do at the park is to swim in the lake. The lake is small but there are a lot of red fish that live in it. There are also some turtles and worms at the bottom of the lake. Sometimes the fish swim by my leg and make me laugh and feel happy. One time I stepped on a stick and cut my foot. That cut hurt and made me sad. The next time I went in the lake I was scared that I would get another cut. Another thing I like to do at the park is to feed the animals. There are lots of pigs, squirrels and raccoon living in the park. Sometimes I feed them bread and crackers. Their favorite thing to eat is ham. After I am done at the park I go to the store to buy some ice cream. Sometimes I see my friend Christopher and he eats his ice cream with me. Christopher also likes feeding the animals. His favorite animal at the park is the squirrel. [Q:] Where is the park? [A:] Next to the hotel.  [Q:] is it small?

CHAPTER VII 

The Beginning of Troubles 

Lily, as she parted with her lover in the garden, had required of him to attend upon her the next morning as he went to his shooting, and in obedience to this command he appeared on Mrs Dale's lawn after breakfast, accompanied by Bernard and two dogs. The men had guns in their hands, and were got up with all proper sporting appurtenances, but it so turned out that they did not reach the stubble-fields on the farther side of the road until after luncheon. And may it not be fairly doubted whether croquet is not as good as shooting when a man is in love? 

It will be said that Bernard Dale was not in love; but they who bring such accusation against him, will bring it falsely. He was in love with his cousin Bell according to his manner and fashion. It was not his nature to love Bell as John Eames loved Lily; but then neither would his nature bring him into such a trouble as that which the charms of Amelia Roper had brought upon the poor clerk from the Income-tax Office. Johnny was susceptible, as the word goes; whereas Captain Dale was a man who had his feelings well under control. He was not one to make a fool of himself about a girl, or to die of a broken heart; but, nevertheless, he would probably love his wife when he got a wife, and would be a careful father to his children.  [Q:] Would people claim bernard wasn't in love? [A:] yes  [Q:] was it true? [A:] no  [Q:] Lily left her romantic partner where? [A:] in the garden  [Q:] what did she want him to do? [A:] to attend upon her  [Q:] what relation to him was Bernard's love? [A:] doubting  [Q:] Was bernard's partner related to him? [A:] yes  [Q:] how? [A:] cousin  [Q:] Did Liliy's man do as instructed? [A:] yes  [Q:] who was he with? [A:] Bernard  [Q:] any other companions? [A:] yes
Guinness World Records, known from its inception in 1955 until 1998 as The Guinness Book of Records and in previous United States editions as The Guinness Book of World Records, is a reference book published annually, listing world records both of human achievements and the extremes of the natural world. The book itself holds a world record, as the best-selling copyrighted book of all time. As of the 2017 edition, it is now in its 63rd year of publication, published in 100 countries and 23 languages. The international franchise has extended beyond print to include television series and museums. The popularity of the franchise has resulted in "Guinness World Records" becoming the primary international authority on the cataloging and verification of a huge number of world records; the organization employs official record adjudicators authorized to verify the authenticity of the setting and breaking of records. 

On 10 November 1951, Sir Hugh Beaver, then the managing director of the Guinness Breweries, went on a shooting party in the North Slob, by the River Slaney in County Wexford, Ireland. After missing a shot at a golden plover, he became involved in an argument over which was the fastest game bird in Europe, the golden plover or the red grouse. (It is the plover.) That evening at Castlebridge House, he realized that it was impossible to confirm in reference books whether or not the golden plover was Europe's fastest game bird. Beaver knew that there must be numerous other questions debated nightly in pubs throughout Ireland and abroad, but there was no book in the world with which to settle arguments about records. He realized then that a book supplying the answers to this sort of question might prove successful. [Q:] What does the Guinness Book record? [A:] world records  [Q:] What world record does the book itself hold? [A:] best-selling copyrighted book of all time  [Q:] What publication year is it in as of 2017? [A:] its 63rd  [Q:] In how many languages is it available? [A:] 23  [Q:] and how many countries? [A:] 100  [Q:] What year did Sir Hugh Beaver go to a shooting party? [A:] 1951  [Q:] What was his argument about? [A:] which was the fastest game bird in Europe  [Q:] And what is the answer to thtat? [A:] the golden plover  [Q:] Was he the mind behind Guinness book?

A great loss--Shirley Temple dies at 85 

February 12,2014 

BYDERRIKJ.LANG ,Associated Press 

Shirley Temple Black, who died on February 10that age 85, wasn't just a child star. She was THE child star--the sweet little girl whose shining smile helped _ some of the darkest days the US has known during the Great Depression. 

It's hard today to imagine the super star Shirley was once "America's Little Darling". She sang and danced her way to the top of the box office in such films as Bright Eyes, Curly Top and Heidi. By 1940, she had appeared in 43 films. Temple teamed with Bill Robison in four movies, and their dance on the stairs in The Little Colonel is still a legendary film moment. 

In the 1930s, her name on a movie introduction assured a packed house. She inspired dolls, dresses, dishes--even a drink (alcohol-free, of course). 

US President Franklin D. Roosevelt once famously said that "as long as our country has Shirley Temple, we will be all right.'' 

Unlike so many of today's child stars, Temple didn't end up with her name appearing across the headlines for bad behaviors. Instead of getting her photos on front pages or struggling with drugs and alcohol, Temple went on to a second career in diplomacy , including presidential appointments as ambassador to Ghana. 

She surprised a lot of people who doubted her with her grace, knowledge and eagerness to serve. In fact, her career in public service (20 years) was longer than her career in movies (19). The role she valued most, however, was as wife, mother, grandmother and great-grandmother. 

The world has lost a treasured Hollywood legend. But her movies will allow that little dynamic figure to continue charming audiences for a very long time. [Q:] Who is this news story about? [A:] Shirley Temple Black  [Q:] In what industry did she become famous? [A:] Entertainment.  [Q:] How many movies did she appear in? [A:] 43 films.  [Q:] Any examples? [A:] Bright Eyes, Curly Top  [Q:] Did she continue to act her whole life? [A:] No.  [Q:] What else did she do? [A:] Second career in diplomacy.  [Q:] Would you say her family or carrer was more important to her? [A:] Family.  [Q:] How old was she when she started acting? [A:] Four.  [Q:] And during what period of US history was that? [A:] The Great Depression.  [Q:] What nick-name did she pickup? [A:] "America's Little Darling
Tuscany is a region in central Italy with an area of about and a population of about 3.8 million inhabitants (2013). The regional capital is Florence ("Firenze").

CHAPTER VI. 

AN OBSTINATE DETECTIVE. 

Dan was in a fine temper when Seth finally released his hold, and after understanding that it would be useless to pursue the fugitive he turned upon his partner savagely. 

"A nice kind of a chump you are! Let a feller burn your house down, an' then pay him fifteen cents for doin' it! After that, when I make up my mind to give him the dose he needs, you turn against me to help him! I s'pose that's what you call bein' a chum of mine?" 

"That's exactly what it is, Dan," Seth replied soothingly. "After you've cooled off a bit you'll be glad I didn't let you pitch into a feller who wouldn't raise his hands." 

"He didn't 'cause he don't dare." 

"If a feller had any spunk about him he would dare to do all he could while somebody else was thumpin' him. Jip feels bad for what he did to us, an' would stand still to let you pound him; but it couldn't have done you any good, Dan. You don't want to get the name of bein' a bruiser." 

"I'd be willin' to take 'most any kind of a name rather'n let Jip Collins off without so much as turnin' a hair on his head!" 

"That's the way you feel jest now 'cause you're off your base; but wait a couple of hours, an' then you'll talk different." 

"I won't if I live to be twice as gray-headed as ever Methuselah was, for it's a downright shame to let him go with money in his pockets after tryin' to kill us."  [Q:] Who was in a temper?

CHAPTER X. 

THE VISIT TO MARY ERSKINE'S. 

Malleville and Phonny arrived at Mary Erskine's about an hour after Beechnut left them. They met with no special adventures by the way, except that when they reached the great pine-tree, Phonny proposed to climb up, for the purpose of examining a small bunch which he saw upon one of the branches, which he thought was a bird's nest. It was the same pine-tree that marked the place at which a road branched off into the woods, where Mary Bell had lost her way, several years before. Malleville was very unwilling to have Phonny climb up upon such a high tree, but Phonny himself was very desirous to make the attempt. There was a log fence at the foot of the tree, and the distance was not very great from the uppermost log of the fence, to the lowermost branch of the tree. So Phonny thought that he could get up without any difficulty. 

Malleville was afraid to have him try, and she said that if he did, he would be acting just as foolish as the boy that Beechnut had told them about, who nipped his own nose; and that she should not stop to see him do any such foolishness. So she walked along as fast as she could go. 

Phonny unfortunately was rendered only the more determined to climb the tree by Malleville's opposition. He accordingly mounted up to the top of the fence, and thence reaching the lower branches of the tree he succeeded at length, by dint of much scrambling and struggling, in lifting himself up among them. He climbed out to the limb where he had seen the appearances of a bird's nest, but found to his disappointment that there was no bird's nest there. The bunch was only a little tuft of twigs growing out together.  [Q:] What is so special about the pine-tree? [A:] It contained a possible bird's nest.  [Q:] What was the bird's nest? [A:] Just a little tuft of twigs growing out together.  [Q:] Who found the nest? [A:] Phonny  [Q:] Was anyone with Phonny? [A:] Yes  [Q:] Who? [A:] Malleville  [Q:] Are they related? [A:] unknown  [Q:] Did they get the nest? [A:] No  [Q:] Did one of them try? [A:] Yes  [Q:] Who tried? [A:] Phonny  [Q:] Did he climb the pine-tree? [A:] Yes  [Q:] How far did he get? [A:] To the limb with twigs.  [Q:] Did he fall out of the tree? [A:] No  [Q:] Did Malleville help? [A:] No
(CNN) -- They are some of the last thoughts of a serial killer, found on blood-soaked, handwritten and often poetic notes in his Alaska jail cell after he took his own life. 

"Speak soft in your ear so you know that it's true. You may have been free, you loved living your lie, fate had its own scheme, crushed like a bug you still die," Israel Keyes wrote. 

Keyes killed himself in December. He was in custody in the killing of barista Samantha Koenig, 18, whom he abducted from a coffee stand in Anchorage, Alaska, last February. Koenig was one of at least eight people Keyes admitted to killing, but he may have taken other lives, police have said. 

Keyes' notes were released by the FBI on Wednesday after they were cleaned up at the bureau's lab in Quantico, Virginia. They were found under his body, written in a combination of pencil and ink on a yellow legal pad, the FBI said in a statement. 

The bureau said the notes don't confirm any of his killings, add any new victims to his grisly toll, or offer any other clues that might help their investigation. It said an analysis showed no hidden messages or code in the four pages. 

But a read of them does give a glimpse into Keyes' mind, apparently describing how it felt to take a life and the disdain in which he held much of American society. 

"I looked in your eyes, they were so dark, warm and trusting as though you had not a worry or care. The more guiless (sp) the gaze the better potential to fill up those pools with your fear," Keyes wrote at one point.  [Q:] who commited suiside ? [A:] Keyes  [Q:] when ?

CHAPTER IV 

The Princess looked up with ill-concealed eagerness as Forrest entered. 

"Well," she asked, "have you any news?" 

Forrest shook his head. 

"None," he answered. "I am up for the day only. Cecil will not let me stay any longer. He was here himself the day before yesterday. We take it by turns to come away." 

"And there is nothing to tell me?" the Princess asked. "No change of any sort?" 

"None," Forrest answered. "It is no good attempting to persuade ourselves that there is any." 

"What are you up for, then?" she asked. 

He laughed hardly. 

"I am like a diver," he answered, "who has to come to the surface every now and then for fresh air. Life down at Salthouse is very nearly the acme of stagnation. Our only excitement day by day is the danger--and the hope." 

"Is Cecil getting braver?" the Princess asked. 

"I think that he is, a little," Forrest answered. 

The Princess nodded. 

"We met him at the Bellamy Smiths'," she said. "It was quite a reunion. Andrew was there, and the Duke." 

Forrest's face darkened. 

"Meddling fool," he muttered. "Do you know that there are two detectives now in Salthouse? They come and go and ask all manner of questions. One of them pretends that he believes Engleton was drowned, and walks always on the beach and hires boatmen to explore the creeks. The other sits in the inn and bribes the servants with drinks to talk. But don't let's talk about this any longer. How is Jeanne?"  [Q:] Who was looking for some message? [A:] The Princess  [Q:] Who did she ask? [A:] Forrest  [Q:] Did they have any messase? [A:] no  [Q:] Did anyone obsturcting him? [A:] yes  [Q:] Who was that? [A:] Cecil  [Q:] Did he arrive early?

[A:] Is Cecil getting braver  [Q:] Did she get any response? [A:] yes  [Q:] What was it? [A:] he is  [Q:] Where did they meet him? [A:] Bellamy Smiths  [Q:] How many other folks were there? [A:] two  [Q:] Who were they? [A:] Andrew and the Duke.  [Q:] How was Forest's response to that? [A:] his  face darkened.  [Q:] Was he worried about somone's presence there?

"It's 8:15 on a Sunday morning," said the officer, Tidwell, "and this sort of thing seems an unlikely adventure at such a time. Would you mind explaining?" The man was astonished at the voice from behind. He turned about and said, "I know what you're thinking, officer, but it isn't true. It's a very funny mistake." "I think you've just left this house in a manner rather than the usual one. That may be quite all right, but I'd like to make sure." Tidwell took out his notebook and a pen. "Name, address and occupation and then, please tell me your story." "Charlie Crane, lorry driver, from Nottingham, 51 Brecon Street. My story?" "Yes, What were you doing like a fly on that wall, Mr. Crane?" "Well, I had a breakdown yesterday and had to stay the night here. The landlady's name is Mrs. Fern. She gave me breakfast at seven, and I was out of here in the right way and down at the lorry park by half past seven. It was only when I felt around for a cigarette that I realized I'd left $80 under the pillow here. It's a habit I've got into. I even do it almost every day." "I see. Why didn't you miss it when you meant to pay Mrs.? What's her name?" "I paid her last night. You've got to pay when you take the room, see? So I came rushing back, but it's Sunday, and she'd gone back to bed. I rang the bell and banged on the front door for ten minutes before I came round here. Up I went this pipe and the money was still there. You know the rest, and I hope you believe it because...." "Mr. Crane, whatever are you doing here? I thought you'd gone an hour ago." It was Mrs. Fern. [Q:] Who was thought to have left earlier? [A:] Mr. Crane  [Q:] When should he supposed to have left? [A:] an hour ago  [Q:] According to whom? [A:] Mrs. Fern.  [Q:] Were dollars left somewhere? [A:] yes  [Q:] How many? [A:] $80  [Q:] Where? [A:] under the pillow  [Q:] What was he feeling for? [A:] a cigarette  [Q:] What time was it?

Hey! That isn't fair! Knights can't fly! Only wizards like me can! And maybe also witches. Bobby yelled. 

"Yes! They can, too!" Frank said, "They're the most powerful and you can't stop me from flying!" 

"Well, if you fly, then I can fight with a sword, too. It's only fair," Bobby said back. 

"No! They can't! They aren't even strong enough to pick up a sword. They can't even pick up a knife, they're so weak! I don't even know what you're talking about. You're crazy, aren't you?" Frank pointed his finger at Bobby and ran at him with the sword made out of cardboard. 

Bobby jumped out of the way as quickly as he could! Bobby then pointed a finger at Frank. "FREEZE!" 

Frank stopped in place. "Hey, you can't use the freeze spell. How can I fight you if I can't move? I'm going to tell mom." 

"I can use any spell I want! I can use Freeze, Trap, and Fly! I can do any of them! I'm also telling mom that you think you can fly and you can't. You're a stupid knight with no brains. I have all the brains here." Bobby crossed his arms over his chest and stomped a foot on the ground. 

"You take that back! I'm the smartest knight there is and I'll get you any day!" Suddenly, Frank pulled Bobby to the ground. "Take it back right now!" 

"BOYS! What's all the noise?" Mom asked. 

"Bobby called me stupid!" Frank yelled. 

"Frank is trying to fly!" Bobby cried. 

"Oh boy." Mom laughed. [Q:] What character is Frank playing? [A:] Knight  [Q:] Who thinks knights can fly? [A:] Frank  [Q:] Who thinks they can't? [A:] bobby  [Q:] Who first casts a freeze spell?

The sun was rising in the morning and the birds were waking up. A mother bird was watching over her baby eggs in the nest. She laid four eggs yesterday, some white and some spotted. She had been keeping them warm so that her babies would soon be born. Little cracks appeared on the eggs and they started to grow and grow. Little "cheeping" sounds could be heard coming from inside, and soon the eggs cracked open. Featherless baby birds were inside, crying for food. The mother had nothing to give, so she quickly flew to the ground and looked in the dirt for food. She saw some worms wiggling in the ground. She picked a few up with her beak and flew them up to the nest. The babies were well fed with the worms, and the mother kept them all warm in the cold spring morning. Mr. Bird came home to find his new babies, and they were all a happy family. [Q:] what sort of eggs were in a nest? [A:] some white and some spotted.  [Q:] what sort of animal? [A:] bird  [Q:] Who was looking over them? [A:] mother bird  [Q:] how many were there> [A:] four  [Q:] when did she lay them? [A:] yesterday,  [Q:] what first showed up on them?

CHAPTER NINE. 

A STORM BREWING--IT BURSTS, AND PRODUCES CONSEQUENCES--THE PARTY TAKE TO THE WATER PER FORCE--ALL SAVED. 

"Ah, Bryan! `a friend in need is a friend indeed,'" said Frank, as he sat on a rock watching the blacksmith and his two Indians while they performed the operation of skinning the bear, whose timely destruction has been related in the last chapter. "I must say I never saw a man stand his ground so well, with a brute like that stealing kisses from his cheek. Were they sweet, Bryan? Did they remind you of the fair maid of Derry, hey?" 

"Ah! thrue for ye," replied the blacksmith, as he stepped to a rock for the purpose of whetting his knife; "yer honour was just in time to save me a power o' throuble. Bad skran to the baste! it would have taken three or four rounds at laste to have finished him nately off, for there's no end o' fat on his ribs that would have kep' the knife from goin' far in." 

Frank laughed at this free-and-easy way of looking at it. "So you think you would have killed him, do you, if I had not saved you the trouble?" 

"Av coorse I do. Shure a man is better than a baste any day; and besides, had I not a frind at my back ridy to help me?" Bryan cast a comical leer at La Roche as he said this, and the poor Frenchman blushed, for he felt that his conduct in the affair had not been very praiseworthy. It is due to La Roche to say, however, that no sooner had he found himself at the top of the tree, and had a moment to reflect, than he slid rapidly to the bottom again, and ran to the assistance of his friend, not, however, in time to render such assistance available, as he came up just at the moment the bear fell.

Sanaa, Yemen (CNN) -- Yemen's information minister escaped an assassination attempt unharmed Tuesday, his office manager said. 

The minister, Ali al-Amrani, was headed to the prime minister's office when the attack occurred, spokesman Abdul Basit al-Qaedi told CNN. 

At least 10 bullets were shot in the direction of the vehicle al-Amrani was getting into, al-Qaedi said. Three bullets hit the back window and trunk of the car, he added. 

Witnesses said there were at least two gunmen. 

Al-Amrani was not hurt in the attack, al-Qaedi said. 

The minister's office said al-Amrani has been targeted recently in a hate campaign by pro-revolution groups. 

"A number of factions in the country started a hate campaign against the minister and threats were given to him in the past," said al-Qaedi. 

Yemen's Interior Ministry told CNN the attack is under investigation, but there are no prime suspects. 

Last week, al-Amrani received a death threat by an anonymous caller from a Saudi telephone number, al-Qaedi said. 

The minister recently launched a massive presidential campaign to support candidate Abdurabu Hadi, the country's current vice president. 

Al-Amrani told CNN the country is facing a critical time for change and all Yemenis must stand together to support Hadi. 

Yemen has been beset with demonstrations against President Ali Abdullah Saleh since early last year, when pro-democratic uprisings spread across the Arab world. 

Demonstrators have continued their protests against the president, despite a power transfer deal that leads to his departure. 

Under the plan, Saleh -- who's been in office for 33 years -- will step down after the February 21 elections and will receive immunity under the plan forged by the Gulf Cooperation Council.

Las Vegas (CNN)Tammy Meyers and Erich Nowsch were neighbors. Their homes are walking distance from each other and from a park. 

It was in that park where, according to Meyers' husband, she used to talk to the young man, where she implored him to act like an adult. 

On Thursday, Nowsch was arrested, accused of killing Meyers in what has been described as a road rage incident that ended a week ago with a shooting in front of Meyers' home. 

"We know this boy. I couldn't tell you this before," Robert Meyers told reporters after the arrest. "He knew where I lived. We knew how bad he was, but we didn't know it was this bad. That he'd gotten to this point, and his friends." 

Nowsch, 19, faces three felony charges: murder, attempted murder and unlawful discharge of a gun from a vehicle. A Monday morning court hearing has been scheduled. 

Robert Meyers said his wife tried to help Nowsch. 

"My wife spent countless hours at that park consoling this boy," he said. "She was really good to him. She fed him, she gave him money. She told him to pull his pants up and to be a man. More times than I can count." 

Police said they are looking for at least one more suspect, but they believe Nowsch was the shooter. Homicide Capt. Chris Tomaino told reporters that he owned registered firearms but wouldn't say how many guns or what type of weapons they were. 

It was unclear Thursday night whether Nowsch had an attorney; court documents detailing his charges didn't list a lawyer.  [Q:] Who were neighbors?

(CNN) -- November 6, 2008, 9:06 a.m.: Ernie Casillas can peg the downward spiral of his life to that exact minute, when he was fired from his job as a mortgage broker. Barack Obama had just been elected president as Casillas was leaving the work force. 

Nearly four years later, as Obama seeks reelection, Casillas has finally landed his first full-time job, emerging out of the group known as the long-term unemployed. 

The Labor Department's July employment figures on Friday showed the average duration of unemployment shrank from 39.9 weeks in June to 38.8 weeks in July. The percentage of people who are unemployed long-term (27 weeks or longer) shrank from 41.9% in June to 40.7% in July. 

Casillas says his life is evidence that the economy is beginning to turn around. But the road to his new job was painful, heartbreaking and financially devastating. 

July jobs report: Hiring picks up, unemployment rises 

He remembers his life pre-November 2008: He wore expensive suits, drove a Mercedes and spent every cent of his paycheck. When he was laid off, he thought he'd be back at work in two weeks. 

He was wrong. 

The subprime mortgage crisis was eating away at the U.S. economy. Employers were shedding jobs, not adding them. A few credits shy of his associate degree, Casillas found himself overqualified for many jobs but underqualified for higher-paid middle-class ones. 

"Overqualified, what does that mean?" Casillas remembers. "They kept telling me that. Meanwhile, my life is going down the drain." 

He lost his house, his Mercedes, and then his wife left him. In his 40s, he was forced to take the humiliating step of moving in with his mother. A year after he lost his job, he began selling everything he owned on Craigslist.  [Q:] Who's the article about? [A:] Ernie Casillas  [Q:] When was he fired?

Sports Illustrated is an American sports media franchise owned by Time Inc. Its self-titled magazine has over 3 million subscribers and is read by 23 million people each week, including over 18 million men. It was the first magazine with circulation over one million to win the National Magazine Award for General Excellence twice. Its swimsuit issue, which has been published since 1964, is now an annual publishing event that generates its own television shows, videos and calendars. 

There were two magazines named "Sports Illustrated" before the current magazine began on August 16, 1954. In 1936, Stuart Scheftel created "Sports Illustrated" with a target market for the sportsman. He published the magazine from 1936 to 1938 on a monthly basis. The magazine was a life magazine size and focused on golf, tennis, and skiing with articles on the major sports. He then sold the name to Dell Publications, which released "Sports Illustrated" in 1949 and this version lasted 6 issues before closing. Dell's version focused on major sports (baseball, basketball, boxing) and competed on magazine racks against "Sport" and other monthly sports magazines. During the 1940s these magazines were monthly and they did not cover the current events because of the production schedules. There was no large-base, general, weekly sports magazine with a national following on actual active events. It was then that "Time" patriarch Henry Luce began considering whether his company should attempt to fill that gap. At the time, many believed sports was beneath the attention of serious journalism and did not think sports news could fill a weekly magazine, especially during the winter. A number of advisers to Luce, including "Life" magazine's Ernest Havemann, tried to kill the idea, but Luce, who was not a sports fan, decided the time was right. [Q:] What's the topic of focus? [A:] Sports Illustrated  [Q:] How many people read their magazine? [A:] 23 million  [Q:] How many subscribe to it? [A:] over 3 million  [Q:] How many of the readers of male?

Scott Alan woke up very early that morning in his bedroom in his house. He felt something licking his face and he wasn't sure what it was. As he opened his green eyes slowly, he saw a bit of fur. Then he saw a tongue. After that, some more fur and then slurp! He was licked again! 

"Oh, Boscoe!" the little boy said with joy as he kissed his furry little brown dog. The dog had been Scott's friend for as long as could remember. They went on many adventures together. The two of them really never left each other's side and Scott woke up many times this way. 

One of the most memorable adventures that Scott and Boscoe had happened when Scott was 12. Scott wanted to have a little fun. He also wanted to adventure with Boscoe. Scott had got done eating breakfast and wanted to ride his bicycle. Boscoe was walking and Scott was riding his bicycle down by the park very close to the river near Scott's house. He wanted to do a little adventuring. Boscoe was walking next to the shore and started barking his head off! Scott wasn't sure what he was barking at, so he got off his bicycle and ran down into the river to see what all the noise was about. 

All of the sudden, Boscoe fell in the water and was taken down stream with the fast water. Scott yelled, "Boscoe!" and he was off. He jumped into the water and began swimming after Boscoe. Boscoe's little legs were doggy paddling as fast as they could, but had no hope! Finally, Scott caught up to him, but he couldn't get back to the side of the river! 

As Scott was thinking this was the last of him and Boscoe, a large stick from a fallen log was well in reach and Scott grabbed it and using all of this might, he pulled him and Boscoe out of the river. 

"Boy, was that close!" Scott yelled out loud! 

That was the best adventure ever! [Q:] Who awoke? [A:] Scott Alan  [Q:] what time of day? [A:] morning  [Q:] late? [A:] No  [Q:] where was he?

Living in a foreign culture can be exciting, but it can also be confusing . A group of Americans who taught English in other countries recently discussed their experiences. They decided that miscommunications were always possible, even over something as simple as"yes"and"no". On her first day in Micronesia, an island in the Pacific, Lisa thought people weren't paying any attention to her. The day was hot. She went into a store and asked, "Do you have cold drinks? "The woman there didn't say anything. Lisa repeated the question. Still the woman said nothing. She later learned that the woman had answered her: She had raised her eyebrows , which in Micronesia means"yes". Jan remembered an experience she had in Bulgaria, a country in Europe. She went to a restaurant that was known for its cabbage. She asked the waiter, "Do you have cabbage today? "He nodded his head. Jan waited, but the cabbage never came. In that country, a nod means"no". Tom had a similar problem when he arrived in India. After explaining something in class, he asked his students if they understood. They answered with many different nods and shakes of the head. He thought some people had not understood, so he explained again. When he asked again, they did the same thing. He soon found out that his students did understand. In India, people nod and shake their heads in different ways depending on where they come from. You have to know where a person is from to understand whether they mean"yes"or"no". [Q:] Where did Lisa talk about? [A:] Micronesia  [Q:] and what is that?

Once upon a time there was a cute brown puppy. He was a very happy puppy. His name was Rudy. Rudy had a best friend. His name was Thomas. Thomas had a nice dad named Rick. Thomas and Rudy had been friends for almost a year. Rudy and Thomas loved to play in the big back yard. Sometimes, Thomas would ask his friend Jacob to come to the back yard and play with them. Jacob would always bring his puppy too. Jacob's puppy was named Sally. Thomas and Jacob would run around the back yard and Rudy and Sally chased them and barked. They all had so much fun playing together. One day, Thomas told Rudy that tomorrow would be a very special day. It would be Rudy's birthday. Rudy was very excited. The next day came and Thomas threw a birthday party for Rudy. All of Rudy's friends were there and they had presents for him. Jacob brought Rudy a new ball and Sally brought him a bone. There was one more present for Rudy to open. When he opened the gift from Thomas, Rudy was so exited that he jumped and barked. It was a new red collar with a shiny name tag on it.

(The Frisky) -- By T-minus 18 days until the Oscars and, of course, we are all starting to place bets on who we think will walk away with little golden men this year. Luckily, the Academy has proven itself to be pretty darn predictable over the years. If you're America's Sweetheart, you'll probably win Best Actress. If you sing in a flick, you are almost guaranteed Oscar gold. But there's another trend we've been noticing lately: the winners for Best Actress and Best Actor tend to be the person who's taken on the based-on-a-true-story role. In fact, 10 of the 20 top honors given in the 2000s went to actors who portrayed real people. Let's take a look, shall we? 

Last year, Sandra Bullock won Best Actress -- just days after taking home a Razzie -- for playing Leigh Anne Tuohy, the Southern mom who took in Michael Oher and helped coach him toward football greatness. The real Leigh Anne was in the theater to see Sandra accept her award.

In 2008, Sean Penn won the Academy Award for Best Actor -- again! -- for playing Harvey Milk, the first openly gay man to be elected to public office in California. 

I still remember the gorgeous mermaid-scale gown that Marion Cotillard won when she accepted the Oscar for Best Actress in 2007 for her role in "La Vie En Rose." In the movie, she played Edith Piaf, an extremely popular singer in France who was also known for her out-of-control social life. In many ways, Marion won for playing the Britney Spears of 1950s France.  [Q:] What is becoming predictable? [A:] The Academy.  [Q:] Who might just winn the best actress? [A:] America's Sweetheart.

(CNN) -- Smart, successful, funny and handsome. Robin Williams seemed to have it all. And yet, today he is dead. Apparently, by his own choice. 

But why? What went wrong? 

The joy, spontaneity and humor of Robin Williams likely masked the daily torment he endured in his on-again-off-again struggle with depression. He made us laugh out here, but he was in pain in there. Unfortunately, I know that pain. 

In his death, we have lost one of the most talented and creative spirits on the planet. Still, his death by suicide should be a wake-up call for us all. It is to remind us that many of us are walking a fine line -- smiling on the outside while slowly dying on the inside. 

I didn't know Robin personally, so I am unable to speak with any certainty as to why he chose to end his life. But I have experienced that kind of torment and pain. For years, I, too, struggled with depression. And many days, I still do. 

Complete coverage on Robin Williams 

Those who are suffering will do just about anything not to feel the pain anymore. And in those moments, their brains become their worst enemies. It often takes an outside force to provide light, to make sure those dark thoughts aren't, as in the case of Robin, our last thoughts. 

According to the Centers for Disease Center, suicide rates increased from 2000 to 2011 from 10.4 deaths per 100,000 to 12.3 deaths per 100,000. 

The rate of suicide is higher and rising among men. In 2011, 78.5% of suicides were by men, at a rate of 20.2 deaths per 100,000.  [Q:] Is Robin Williams still living? [A:] no  [Q:] What happened to him? [A:] suicide  [Q:] What made him do that? [A:] depression  [Q:] Did that effect him all the time? [A:] no  [Q:] What hid his struggle from other? [A:] his humor  [Q:] What did it look like he had? [A:] Heseemed to have it all.  [Q:] Does suicide occur most often in males or females? [A:] males  [Q:] What percentage were they responsible for in 2011? [A:] 78.5  [Q:] How many is that for every 100,000? [A:] 20.2  [Q:] What happened with suicide between 2000 and 2011? [A:] the rate increased  [Q:] What was it in 2000? [A:] 10.4 deaths per 100,000  [Q:] And in 2011? [A:] 12.3 deaths per 100,000.  [Q:] Was Robin Williams successfu?

Yorkshire ( or ; abbreviated Yorks), formally known as the County of York, is a historic county of Northern England and the largest in the United Kingdom. Due to its great size in comparison to other English counties, functions have been undertaken over time by its subdivisions, which have also been subject to periodic reform. Throughout these changes, Yorkshire has continued to be recognised as a geographical territory and cultural region. The name is familiar and well understood across the United Kingdom and is in common use in the media and the military, and also features in the titles of current areas of civil administration such as North Yorkshire, South Yorkshire, West Yorkshire and East Riding of Yorkshire. 

Within the borders of the historic county of Yorkshire are areas which are widely considered to be among the greenest in England, due to the vast stretches of unspoilt countryside in the Yorkshire Dales and North York Moors and to the open aspect of some of the major cities. Yorkshire has sometimes been nicknamed "God's Own County" or "God's Own Country". 

The emblem of Yorkshire is the White Rose of the English royal House of York, and the most commonly used flag representative of Yorkshire is the White Rose on a blue background, which after nearly fifty years of use, was recognised by the Flag Institute on 29 July 2008. Yorkshire Day, held annually on 1 August, is a celebration of the general culture of Yorkshire, ranging from its history to its own dialect.

There once was an elephant named Ellie. 

She really liked to eat peanuts. 

She lived with a circus and performed with clowns. 

One day she was really hungry and could not find any peanuts. 

She asked the lion, "Do you have any peanuts?" 

The lion said, "Sorry, I don't like peanuts, but the squirrel may have some." 

Ellie went looking for the squirrel and along the way saw a little girl. 

The little girl was crying. 

Ellie asked the little girl, "Why are you crying?" 

The little girl, Ava, said, "I lost my parents!" 

The elephant put Ava on her back and said, "I can help you look for them." 

They looked high and low for Ava's parents. 

Ellie made a loud sound with her nose and Ava's parents came to see what it was! 

Her parents were so happy to find Ava and so was Ellie. 

Ellie's stomach began to growl and Ava heard it. 

She dug into her parent's bag and brought out a bag of peanuts!

The Rover family goes to the park for a wonderful picnic. The Rovers are a family of dogs. Mommy Rover packs a lunch which includes lots of doggie treats like dog bones and chew sticks. Daddy Rover brings the dog toys - an old Frisbee and a shoe that can be used for some fun activities - so their puppies, Paulie and Lucky, have games to play. It is a bright sunny day at the dog park. Lots of other doggie families are also at the park enjoying the nice weather. The Rovers see their friends, the Fidos, and invite them to join them for lunch. The two families eat and play together. Afterwards, it's nap time for the pups. The adult dogs clean up the leftover food. They pack the extra food in doggie bags - and pack their baskets and head home. The day was a lot of fun for all the dogs.

Linda was kind of late. Linda, 25, had a lot to do at work, plus visitors on the way: her parents were coming in for Thanksgiving from her hometown. But as she hurried down the subway stairs, she started to feel uncomfortably warm. By the time she got to the platform, Linda felt weak and tired -- maybe it hadn't been a good idea to give blood the night before, she thought. She rested herself against a post close to the tracks. 

Several yards away, Frank, 43, and his girlfriend, Jennifer, found a spot close to where the front of the train would stop. They were deep in discussion about a house they were thinking of buying. 

But when he heard the scream, followed by someone yelling, "Oh, my God, she fell in!"Frank didn't hesitate. He jumped down to the tracks and ran some 40 feet toward the body lying on the rails. "No ! Not you ! "his girlfriend screamed after him. 

She was right to be alarmed. By the time Frank reached Linda, he could feel the tracks shaking and see the light coming. The train was about 20 seconds from the station. 

It was hard to lift her. She was just out. But he managed to raise her the four feet to the platform so that bystanders could hold her by the arms and drag her away from the edge. That was where Linda briefly regained consciousness, felt herself being pulled along the ground, and saw someone else holding her purse. 

Linda thought she'd been robbed. A woman held her hand and a man gave his shirt to help stop the blood pouring from her head. And she tried to talk but she couldn't, and that was when she realized how much pain she was in. 

Police and fire officials soon arrived, and Frank told the story to an officer. Jennifer said her boyfriend was calm on their 40minute train ride downtown--just as he had been seconds after the rescue, which made her think about her reaction at the time. "I saw the train coming and I was thinking he was going to die, " she explained. [Q:] How old is Linda? [A:] 25  [Q:] was she early? [A:] no  [Q:] who was coming to visit?

(CNN) -- The man labeled the most powerful vice president in American history remains resolute in his steadfast defense of his time in the White House in a new documentary that begins airing Friday. 

"I did what I did. It's all on the public record, and I feel very good about it. If I had to do it over again, I'd do it in a minute," Dick Cheney says in "The World According to Dick Cheney," which debuts at 9 p.m. ET on Showtime. 

The two-hour documentary tells the story of Cheney's life through his own comments, supplemented by a narrator and interviews with journalists, biographers, former aides and his longtime friend and mentor Donald Rumsfeld, the former secretary of Defense. 

While the film covers Cheney's unprecedented and controversial role as vice president, the first half of the film explores the surprising tale of his rise from a two-time Yale dropout with two drunk-driving arrests to the man who once stood behind the leader of the free world. 

In "The World According to Dick Cheney," produced by R.J. Cutler — also known for "The War Room" and "The September Issue" -- the former Washington powerhouse gets personal, but he still maintains his ever-steady, matter-of-fact tone. 

"When you came in at night after work, you'd go to the bar and down large quantities of Coors beer," he stated coolly, referring to the two times he was arrested for drinking and driving in his home state of Wyoming. 

Noticeably absent from the documentary are details about Cheney's post-White House life. The 72-year-old gives little to no insight about his heart transplant last year or his decision to support same-sex marriage. His younger daughter Mary wed her longtime partner Heather Poe in June.

Plymouth (i/ˈplɪməθ/) is a city on the south coast of Devon, England, about 37 miles (60 km) south-west of Exeter and 190 miles (310 km) west-south-west of London, between the mouths of the rivers Plym to the east and Tamar to the west where they join Plymouth Sound to form the boundary with Cornwall. 

Plymouth's early history extends to the Bronze Age, when a first settlement emerged at Mount Batten. This settlement continued as a trading post for the Roman Empire, until it was surpassed by the more prosperous village of Sutton, now called Plymouth. In 1620, the Pilgrim Fathers departed Plymouth for the New World and established Plymouth Colony – the second English settlement in what is now the United States of America. During the English Civil War the town was held by the Parliamentarians and was besieged between 1642 and 1646. 

Throughout the Industrial Revolution, Plymouth grew as a commercial shipping port, handling imports and passengers from the Americas, and exporting local minerals (tin, copper, lime, china clay and arsenic) while the neighbouring town of Devonport became a strategic Royal Naval shipbuilding and dockyard town. In 1914 three neighbouring independent towns, viz., the county borough of Plymouth, the county borough of Devonport, and the urban district of East Stonehouse were merged to form a single County Borough. The combined town took the name of Plymouth which, in 1928, achieved city status. The city's naval importance later led to its targeting and partial destruction during World War II, an act known as the Plymouth Blitz. After the war the city centre was completely rebuilt and subsequent expansion led to the incorporation of Plympton and Plymstock along with other outlying suburbs in 1967.

(CNN) -- For the first time since the massacre at Sandy Hook Elementary School, Christine Wilford plans do something remarkable on Thursday that once was routine: drop her child off at school. 

The last time her 7-year-old son, Richie, was in class was on December 14, when a gunman smashed his way into his school in Newtown, Connecticut, and killed 26 children and adults. 

As shots rang out, Richie's teacher locked the door and huddled her students into the corner as the shooter roamed the hallways, wielding an AR-15 assault rifle and firing. 

When it appeared safe, the children were then hurried away to a nearby fire station, where teary parents either reunited with their sons and daughters or learned that they had been killed. 

Nearly a month later, Wilford said her son still has trouble sleeping and is often scared by loud noises. 

Newtown chooses faith, charity, hope 

But on Thursday, he will join hundreds of other Newtown students returning to class for the first time since the tragedy. 

"We think it's good he's going back," Wilford said. "If I leave my child anywhere, I'm leaving a piece of my heart, so it's difficult to leave him." 

'I think I'll be OK,' Sandy Hook student says after first day 

But Richie apparently isn't afraid and says he's looking forward to seeing his friends, she said. 

They won't be attending Sandy Hook Elementary, which police say remains part of an ongoing investigation into Adam Lanza, the gunman who also killed his mother before opening fire at the school.

A boy named Pedro was walking down the street one day, and he met a pretty girl in a pink dress who handed him a bell. It was made of metal, and looked worn and old. The girl said, this bell gave me my wish for a pink dress, but in order to keep my wish, I have to give the bell to someone else. Ring the bell three times to get your wish. Not two, not four, but three. When your wish arrives, give the bell to someone else. Pedro thanked the girl for the bell, and when she had gone, he rang the bell three times and wished for a puppy. Soon after, he saw a puppy on a street corner. It was black with brown and white spots. He picked the puppy up and hugged it. Then he saw his friend Alice. He gave the bell to Alice, who rang the bell and wished for a pretty bird. Soon a pretty bird landed on her shoulder.

Jack and Mackenzie wanted to do something fun during their day off from school. They knew that the library had story time on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday. Their mother told them they could go to the library every Tuesday for their story time. They packed up the car and drove to the library, ready for a fun morning. 

When they arrived to the story room, there were lots of other children their age, all sitting cross-legged and ready for the story of the day. The teacher told them they would be reading "The Wild Horse". She began to tell the story of Majestic, the wild horse who could not be calmed. His people had tried and tried to break him, but he was wild at heart. Every time they took him to the river to drink, he would run straight into the water and get soaking wet! He would splash and play until he was ready to go back home, where he would sleep for hours, having worn himself out playing. [Q:] Did the library have story time?

Once there was a white horse named Bob, who lived in a house with his best friend. His friend was a cat named Shelly who loved to play baseball. The two of them would go to the park and play baseball with Lucy a lamb who lived next door. 

It was Friday morning and Bob and Shelly were in the park waiting for Lucy. She was late and when she finally showed up she had forgotten the ball. 

"What can we use for a ball?" Bob asked. They looked around. There were rocks but they were too hard. There could get mud out of the pond but that would be too soft and splat when they hit it with the wooden bat. Finally Bob, being the tallest, saw that in a pile of plants that there were melons growing. "Let's use a melon," Bob said. "That's stupid," said Shelly, the practical one. "No hear him out," said Lucy. "It might work. "It'll work," said Bob, and he picked a melon and handed it to Shelly. "You pitch." "This is going to end badly, I'm afraid," Shelly said, throwing the melon at Bob who stood over home plate. "I know what I'm doing," Bob said, swinging the bat as hard as he could. When the bat hit the melon it splatted into a million pieces, raining sticky pieces down on Bob and Shelly and Lucy and a wedding party that had been setting up nearby. "Oops," said Bob. [Q:] Did the horse have a name? [A:] yes  [Q:] what was it? [A:] Bob  [Q:] who was his friend? [A:] a cat  [Q:] does it have a name? [A:] yes  [Q:] what is it? [A:] Shelly  [Q:] where'd they go?

CHAPTER XII 

THE MEETING OF THE GEE EYES 

When Link Merwell went down again Dave looked at Nat Poole, thinking that lad might possibly attack him. But the dudish fellow was too scared to do anything but back away to a safe distance. 

"Don--don't you dare to hit me, Porter!" he cried, in a trembling voice. "Don't you dare! If you do I'll tell Doctor Clay!" 

"If you behave yourself I'll not lay my fingers on you, Nat Poole," was the reply. "Merwell brought this on himself--you know that as well as I do." 

"He's pretty badly hurt, I fear." 

"Oh, he'll come around all right," answered Dave. "You had better see to it that he gets to the Hall safely." 

"Are you going to leave me?" 

"Yes, I want to find Henshaw and the others." 

Nat Poole wanted to argue, but he did not dare. Dave waited until Link Merwell sat up and opened his eyes. Then he leaped on the ice-boat and flung off the three skates he found there. 

"Going away?" mumbled Merwell, when he could speak. 

"Yes, and after this, Link Merwell, see that you keep a civil tongue in your head," answered Dave, and then he trimmed the sail of the ice-boat, shoved the craft around, and started for the river. 

Dave was a good deal "worked up," but he had not deemed it wise to let his enemies see it. To be called a "poorhouse rat" had stung him to the quick, and once again when touched on that subject he had found his temper as ungovernable as ever.  [Q:] What is the title of the chapter?

CHAPTER XXVII 

TATO IS ADOPTED 

They canvassed the subject of their future travels with considerable earnestness. Uncle John was bent upon getting to Rome and Venice, and from there to Paris, and the nieces were willing to go anywhere he preferred, as they were sure to enjoy every day of their trip in the old world. But Mr. Watson urged them strongly to visit Syracuse, since they were not likely to return to Sicily again and the most famous of all the ancient historic capitals was only a few hours' journey from Taormina. So it was finally decided to pass a week in Syracuse before returning to the continent, and preparations were at once begun for their departure. 

Kenneth pleaded for one more day in which to finish his picture of Etna, and this was allowed him. Uncle John nevertheless confessed to being uneasy as long as they remained on the scene of his recent exciting experiences. Mr. Watson advised them all not to stray far from the hotel, as there was no certainty that Il Duca would not make another attempt to entrap them, or at least to be revenged for their escape from his clutches. 

On the afternoon of the next day, however, they were startled by a call from the Duke in person. He was dressed in his usual faded velvet costume and came to them leading by the hand a beautiful little girl. 

The nieces gazed at the child in astonishment. 

Tato wore a gray cloth gown, ill-fitting and of coarse material; but no costume could destroy the fairy-like perfection of her form or the daintiness of her exquisite features. With downcast eyes and a troubled expression she stood modestly before them until Patsy caught her rapturously in her arms and covered her face with kisses.  [Q:] Who was wanted to get somewhere?

(CNN)Sen. Marco Rubio said he'll make a decision on running for president in the next few weeks and feels confident that he could obtain the resources to "credibly run a campaign and win," despite an increasingly crowded GOP field taking shape. 

In a wide-ranging interview with CNN's Wolf Blitzer, the Florida Republican also gave his thoughts on Republican efforts to defund the president's executive action on immigration, and further explained why he won't support the administration's new Cuba policy. 

2016 

Rubio, who released a new book "American Dreams" on Tuesday, said he's still deciding whether he thinks he can be more effective as president or as a senator under the new majority. He has already said he won't run for both offices in 2016. 

Marco Rubio: Radicalized individuals 'very real threat' to the West 

With power players Mitt Romney and Jeb Bush now considered likely contenders, Rubio said "they're both credible and well-funded" candidates but argued there would still be room for his campaign if he decides to plow forward. 

"I'm confident that if we decide to run for president ... we will have the funding and the resources necessary to credibly run a campaign and win," he said. 

"But I understand that the longer you wait, the harder it becomes to do that," he added. 

Romney tells donors he's considering 2016 bid 

Bush and Romney have already been in active in talking with big-money supporters and securing financial resources, making it strategically more difficult for other potential contenders like Rubio to lock down support from the GOP's donor class.

(CNN) -- The Japanese coast guard has rescued a British woman on a solo round-the-world trip whose boat was damaged when it rolled several times during a tropical storm, her team said Friday. 

Sarah Outen was rescued by the coast guard in rough seas Friday afternoon, the London2London team wrote on its website. 

"Sarah is now making her way to back to Japan," the team wrote. "We are awaiting final confirmation of details of Sarah's arrival in Japan and will let you know more once we have further information." 

A nearby merchant vessel and a coast guard plane kept watch on Outen until the rescue ship arrived. 

Sarah Outen: Around the world on two boats and a bike 

A small amount of water had gotten into the cabin of Outen's boat, Gulliver, but she was "bearing up well and demonstrating the strength and resolve that has brought her the huge distance on the journey so far," the team said before her rescue. 

She asked for pancakes, cold orange juice and grapes for her first meal after arriving in Japan. 

Planning a round-the-world trip 

Coincidentally, a second solo British rower is about 280 miles northeast of Outen's position and is also awaiting rescue, Outen's team said. 

Charlie Martell departed Japan last month on a quest to row 6,000 miles across the Pacific, his website says. 

Outen managed to send updates on Twitter while waiting for rescue, writing, "Trying hard2 smile and breathe calm keep getting interuptd by waves throwing us over."

Toronto is the most populous city in Canada and the provincial capital of Ontario. With a population in 2016 of 2,731,571, it is the fourth most populous city in North America after Mexico City, New York City, and Los Angeles. Toronto is the centre of the Greater Toronto Area (GTA), the most populous metropolitan area in Canada, and anchors the Golden Horseshoe, an urbanized region that is home to 9.2 million people, or over 26% of the population of Canada. A global city, Toronto is an international centre of business, finance, arts, and culture. 

Toronto is located in Southern Ontario on the northwestern shore of Lake Ontario on a broad sloping plateau interspersed with rivers, deep ravines, and urban forest. Indigenous peoples have travelled through and inhabited the area for more than 10,000 years. After the broadly disputed Toronto Purchase, when the Mississaugas surrendered the area to the British Crown, the British established the town of York in 1793, and later designated it as the capital of Upper Canada. During the War of 1812, the town was the site of the Battle of York and suffered heavy damage by U.S. troops. York was renamed and incorporated as the city of Toronto in 1834, and became the capital of the province of Ontario during Canadian Confederation in 1867. The city proper has since expanded past its original borders through both annexation and amalgamation to its current area of . [Q:] where is Toronto located? [A:] Canada  [Q:] what part?

David and Lucy waited in their mom's truck. They all were going to the circus to see the clowns. Their Mom had to take their little brother back into the house to get more diapers and go to the bathroom. David was worried because he did not want to miss the wolf clown. Lucy watched her brother rub his chin. "Why are you looking out the window?" she asked. "Mom needs to hurry. We might miss the clowns." "I am going to get out of the truck and draw triangles in the sand." Lucy said. "No! You might make us miss it." David cried. Before she could get out of the truck Lucy saw her mom and little brother walk out of the house. Her mom got in the truck and asked, "Okay kids are we ready to go?" David and Lucy yelled, "Yes!" When they got to the circus David and Lucy saw all the clowns. Their little brother was too young to go into the tent, so their mom stayed with him. The show ended and they walked to the truck. "What do you have there?" David asked Lucy "It is a bag I found in the tent." Lucy said. "We have to return that Lucy." Their mom said. "Why? It has cool stuff in it. I found it." Lucy said. "It is not ours." Their mom said. Lucy frowned as they walked to the lost and found and gave the bag back. Then they all went home. When they were washing up to go to bed Lucy said, "I fear some of those clowns. The wolf one was scary." "Lucy, I can save you. The wolf clown was a person in make-up."

There was once a group of kittens who all liked to play together. Their names were Fluffy, Snowball, Cookie Monster, and Larry.

The next day Fluffy said, "Hey, everybody, let's go annoy the dogs." Everyone said "Yes" except Larry. Larry thought it was a bad idea. He told Fluffy, and Fluffy only said, "Too bad."

There once was a girl named Erin who had a really close friend named Kevin. They really liked being with each other, only it was difficult as Erin lived in England and Kevin lived in the United States. Because they both liked traveling and Erin wanted to see Kevin, she planned a trip to see him in the United States one summer. They had planned to travel around where Kevin lived and then go to see New York City at one point in order to see the sights and have a really nice steak dinner together. Once Erin arrived and met Kevin at the airport, she ran up to him and jumped into his arms, giving him a great big hug. They drove home where Kevin helped Erin organize her things before they changed and watched a movie together. The next day, they went out to have breakfast at the diner. They thought about getting eggs, French toast, or cereal... but couldn't make up their minds. Finally, Kevin asked the worker to bring out pancakes for the two of them to share. They had a really fun time together, visiting the beach, watching movies, and even visiting New York City like they had planned. In the morning, they went to see the Empire State building. In the afternoon, they saw the Statue of Liberty and Central Park. At night, they went to have their dinner and went back to their hotel.

One sunny day, Lisa and Jane went to the park to play. Lisa was eating her sandwich and saw Jane was swinging with Josh. Josh and Jane have been friends for 3 years and love to play together with Lisa. Lisa then made Jane and Josh a sandwich and called them both over to eat. Josh grabbed one and took a bite. Jane didn't eat her sandwich, she only ate the chips. Lisa asked if they wanted to go play on the slide and they all did. Josh went down the slide first. Jane was scared because the slide was too high up. Josh told Jane that if Lisa can go down the slide, she can too. They both watched Lisa go down the slide with no problem. Jane went up the slide and closed her eyes. When she opened them, she was at the bottom of the slide. Jane had done it and Lisa and Josh were cheering for her! Jane was very happy that she went down the slide. Since Jane went down the slide, everyone had a cupcake. [Q:] where did Lisa and Jane go? [A:] the park  [Q:] to do what?

(CNN)As art, film stills are often overlooked. 

The photographers tend to be anonymous; it's easy to imagine their work done by the director or cinematographer. Their images are often lumped in with the promotional machinery: Whether documenting the stars frolicking on set or getting down to business, it's just another form of salesmanship. 

Which is why the work of Ernst Haas is so striking. 

Haas, one of the 20th century's great photojournalists and image-makers -- an early member of the great Magnum Photos cooperative who was famous enough in his prime to have been the subject of a Museum of Modern Art exhibit in 1962 -- was also a regular on movie sets. It was a necessity in those early days, said John Jacob, the editor of a new book of Haas' movie photography, "Ernst Haas: On Set." 

"Working on film sets was really important to Magnum, and all of the photographers working with Magnum in the '50s did films," says Jacob, now the McEvoy Family Curator for Photography at the Smithsonian American Art Museum. Not only did the work pay off financially, but the photographers also established relationships with members of the industry, he said. 

And the stars and directors knew what they were getting: some of the best in the field. Photographers such as Haas were entrusted to bring their talent and style to the work. 

The photographers "are definitely producing work for posterity, that very much has their own fingerprint on it," Jacob said. 

Such distinction is obvious from looking at Haas' work -- some of which is as famous as the movies he worked on.  [Q:] What art form is usually overlooked? [A:] Film stills  [Q:] Do people usually know who created them? [A:] No  [Q:] Who they actually think created those? [A:] Director or cinematographer.  [Q:] Who is Haas? [A:] Photojournalist.  [Q:] Which era he was active? [A:] 20th century  [Q:] What he was member in? [A:] Magnum Photos cooperative.  [Q:] What was important to them? [A:] Working on film sets.  [Q:] Did the photographers feel the same way? [A:] Yes.  [Q:] Who is Jacob? [A:] The editor of a new book.  [Q:] Where he works? [A:] Smithsonian American Art Museum.  [Q:] Was it a lucrative job for photographers in the 50s? [A:] Yes.  [Q:] What other benefits they got from that job? [A:] Relationships with members of the industry.  [Q:] Were the directors happy about it? [A:] Yes.  [Q:] According to Jacob was the photographers creating art work for the future? [A:] Yes  [Q:] Did some of the works become famous? [A:] Yes.
CHAPTER XXV 

WINNING THE CONTESTS 

Powell was again the first to throw the hammer and this time it went two feet beyond his first mark. 

"Good for you, Songbird!" said Tom. "I wish you had made it a yard." 

Jackson came up with a scowling face. He did his best, but this time fell behind Powell by four inches. 

"You ought to have stuck to the other hammer, Jackson," laughed the youth who composed songs. 

"Don't you throw that up to me!" whispered Jackson fiercely. "If you do I'll hammer you for it." 

"Is that meant for a pun, Jackson?" 

"No, it ain't. I won't stand being slurred. I'll pound you good." 

"With the hammer?" 

"No, with my fists." 

"Really? Well, you'll have to spell able first." Tom came next, as before, and now the hammer flew out four feet and nine inches beyond his first mark. 

"That shows what the other hammer can do," said Major Larry. 

Larson was as much out of sorts as Jackson, but nevertheless he resolved to do his best to win the contest. Up went the hammer with a mighty swing and circled through the air. But the throw was behind that of Tom by fourteen inches. 

"Hurrah! Tom Rover wins!" was the cry, and many rushed forward to congratulate him, while Larson and Jackson retired as quickly as they could and in great disgust. 

The next contest was a dash of two hundred yards and was won by a boy named Bird. 

"He's a bird!" sang out Tom loudly, and at this the crowd laughed heartily.  [Q:] Who fell behind Powell by four inches? [A:] Jackson  [Q:] Who threw the hammer first?

CHAPTER XXIX 

Have you seen but a bright lily grow, Before rude hands have touched it? Have you marked but the fall of the snow, Before the soil hath smutched it?--BEN JONSON 

At the end of a week Mervyn made his appearance in a vehement hurry. Cecily's next sister, an officer's wife, was coming home with two little children, for a farewell visit before going to the Cape, and Maria and Bertha must make way for her. So he wanted to take Phoebe home that afternoon to get the Underwood ready for them. 

'Mervyn, how can I go? I am not nearly ready.' 

'What can you have been doing then?' he exclaimed, with something of his old temper. 

'This house has been in such a state.' 

'Well, you were not wanted to nurse the sick man, were you? I thought you were one that was to be trusted. What more is there to do?' 

Phoebe looked at her list of commissions, and found herself convicted. Those patterns ought to have been sent back two days since. What had she been about? Listening to Mr. Randolf's explanations of the _Hiawatha_ scenery! Why had she not written a note about that hideous hearth-rug? Because Mr. Randolf was looking over Stowe's _Survey of London_. Methodical Phoebe felt herself in disgrace, and yet, somehow, she could not be sorry enough; she wanted a reprieve from exile at Hiltonbury, alone and away from all that was going on. At least she should hear whether _Macbeth_, at the Princess's Theatre, fulfilled Mr. Randolf's conceptions of it; and if Mr. Currie approved his grand map of the Newcastle district, with the little trees that she had taught him to draw.  [Q:] What did Phoebe want a reprieve from? [A:] exile  [Q:] From where? [A:] at Hiltonbury  [Q:] What did she teach Mr. Currie to draw? [A:] little trees  [Q:] What did Mervyn do at week's end?

[A:] No  [Q:] What was the purpose of the officer's wife's trip? [A:] farewell visit  [Q:] Where was she going next? [A:] the Cape  [Q:] Who had to make way for her? [A:] Maria and Bertha
The Board Meeting had come to an end. Bob started to stand up and knocked into the table, spilling his coffee over his notes. "How embarrassing! I am getting so clumsy in my old age." 

Everyone had a good laugh, and soon we were all telling stories of our most embarrassing moments. It came around to Frank, who sat quietly listening to the others. Someone said, "Come on, Frank. Tell us your most embarrassing moment." 

Frank laughed and began to tell us of his childhood. "I grew up in San Pedro. My Dad was a fisherman, and he loved the sea. He had his own boat, but it was hard making a living on the sea. He worked hard and would stay out until he caught enough to feed the family. Not just enough for our family, but also for his Mom and Dad and the other kids that were still at home." 

He looked at us and said, "I wish you could have met my Dad. He was a big man, and he was strong from pulling the nets and fighting the seas for his catch. When you got close to him, he smelled like the ocean. He would wear his old canvas, foul-weather coat and his bibbed overalls. His rain hat would be pulled down over his brow. No matter how much my mother washed them, they would still smell of the sea and of fish." 

Frank's voice dropped a bit. "When the weather was bad he would drive me to school. He had this old truck that he used in his fishing business. That truck was older than he was. It would wheeze and rattle down the road. You could hear it coming for blocks. As he would drive toward the school, I would shrink down into the seat hoping to disappear. Half the time, he would slam to a stop and the old truck would belch a cloud of smoke. He would pull right up in front, and it seemed like everybody would be standing around and watching. Then he would lean over and give me a big kiss on the cheek and tell me to be a good boy. It was so embarrassing for me. Here, I was twelve years old, and my Dad would lean over and kiss me goodbye!" 

He paused and then went on, "I remember the day I decided I was too old for a goodbye kiss. When we got to the school and came to a stop, he had his usual big smile. He started to lean toward me, but I put my hand up and said, "No, Dad." It was the first time I had ever talked to him that way, and he had this surprised look on his face. I said, "Dad, I'm too old for a goodbye kiss. I'm too old for any kind of kiss." My Dad looked at me for the longest time, and his eyes started to tear up. Then he turned and looked out of the windshield . "You're right," he said. " You are a big boy....a man. I won't kiss you anymore." 

Frank got a funny look on his face, and the tears began to well up in his eyes, as he spoke. "It wasn't long after that when my Dad went to sea and never came back. It was a day when most of the fleet stayed in, but not Dad. He had a big family to feed. They found his boat adrift with its nets half in and half out. He must have gotten into a strong wind and was trying to save the nets and the floats." 

I looked at Frank and saw that tears were running down his cheeks. Frank spoke again. "Guys, you don't know what I would give to have my Dad give me just one more kiss on the cheek...to feel his rough old face... to smell the ocean on him... to feel his arm around my neck. _ . If I had been a man, I would never have told my Dad I was too old for a goodbye kiss." [Q:] Why is Frank crying? [A:] Dad went to sea and never came back.  [Q:] Where did he grow up? [A:] San Pedro.  [Q:] What did his dad do for a job? [A:] fisherman  [Q:] Did he own a boat [A:] Yes  [Q:] Was this a hard job? [A:] yes  [Q:] What did he smell like?

[A:] A cloud of smoke  [Q:] What was he attempting to do when a strong wind happened? [A:] save the nets.  [Q:] Did they find the boat? [A:] Yes  [Q:] Did they find his dad? [A:] No  [Q:] What would he like now from his dad? [A:] A kiss

London (CNN) -- Janet Jackson is opening up for the first time about a duet with her brother that she's reviving two years after his death. 

Jackson took to the stage in London on Thursday and performed their 1995 song Scream as video of Michael Jackson played and his voice filled Royal Albert Hall. 

The reworked duet follows in the footsteps of jazz pianist and singer Nat King Cole and his daughter, Natalie Cole. In 1991 she turned her father's famous 1961 recording "Unforgettable" into a father-daughter duet. 

Janet Jackson said she did the original duet at the request of her brother years ago. 

"I was on the Rhythm Nation tour and Mike actually asked me to do a song with him and I told him no. I didn't want to do it. I felt I hadn't come into my own and I hadn't fully made a name for myself ... and I didn't want to ride anyone's coattails," she said. "And I remember being in the Janet Tour a few good years later and he asked me again if I would do a song with him. And I felt, at that point, I'd carved my own little niche in this world of music and I felt okay, I can do this now and that's how it came about." 

Jackson said that performing the song alongside her brother again isn't difficult. 

"It feels great -- just listening to and hearing his voice," she said, adding that on stage she finds herself, "remembering the experience of recording it."  [Q:] Who is doing a show in London?

Strabo (; "Strabōn"; 64 or 63 BC) was a Greek geographer, philosopher, and historian who lived in Asia Minor during the transitional period of the Roman Republic into the Roman Empire. 

Strabo was born to an affluent family from Amaseia in Pontus (modern Amasya, Turkey), a city that he said was situated the approximate equivalent of 75 km from the Black Sea. Pontus had recently fallen to the Roman Republic, and although politically he was a proponent of Roman imperialism, Strabo belonged on his mother's side to a prominent family whose members had held important positions under the previous resisting regime of King Mithridates VI of Pontus. 

Strabo's life was characterized by extensive travels. He journeyed to Egypt and Kush, as far west as coastal Tuscany and as far south as Ethiopia in addition to his travels in Asia Minor and the time he spent in Rome. Travel throughout the Mediterranean and Near East, especially for scholarly purposes, was popular during this era and was facilitated by the relative peace enjoyed throughout the reign of Augustus (27 BC – AD 14). He moved to Rome in 44 BC, and stayed there, studying and writing, until at least 31 BC. In 29 BC, on his way to Corinth (where Augustus was at the time), he visited the island of Gyaros in the Aegean Sea. Around 25 BC, he sailed up the Nile until reaching Philae, after which point there is little record of his proceedings until AD 17. [Q:] Who was born to a rich family?

(CNN) -- There are plenty of country songs about how to be a man. One way is to face the music, and two country crooners did that on Thursday. 

Ty Herndon and Billy Gilman came out as being gay. 

Herdon went first, in interviews with People Magazine and Entertainment Tonight. His revelation inspired Gilman to do go public as well. 

Gilman posted a message to YouTube, thanking Herndon for breaking the ice. He preferred telling his fans directly, from the comfort of home, to sitting down with the press, he said. 

But an encounter with a journalist also prodded him to spill the beans before someone else did. The reporter bumped into Gilman in a public place and snapped a photo of him -- with his partner. 

"It was in that moment that I knew that I'd rather it be from me than you reading it somewhere else," Gilman told fans. He also feared being ripped over his sexuality in an article. 

Country and LGBTQ 

In the genre of country, Thursday's tune was a tough one to sing, Gilman said. "Being a gay, male country artist is not the best thing." 

At age 26, he's had a long career, having rocketed up the charts at age 11 with his then silky, pre-voice-change alto pipes, according to his biography on AllMusic.com. 

But currently, he's hitting snags. 

Rumors about his sexual orientation have been going around, he said, and he thinks major music labels may have thumbed their noses at him over it.  [Q:] Who came out? [A:] Ty Herndon and Billy Gilman  [Q:] What they do? [A:] they are country singers  [Q:] Who went first about it? [A:] Herdo  [Q:] Where? [A:] in interviews with People Magazine and Entertainment Tonight  [Q:] Did his partner follow suit? [A:] unknown  [Q:] Where he acknowledged that? [A:] YouTube  [Q:] Why? [A:] thanking Herndon  [Q:] From where he posted that message? [A:] home  [Q:] Were there rumors about their sexual orientation? [A:] no  [Q:] Did Gilman meet journalists later? [A:] no
Leeds is a city in West Yorkshire, England. Historically in Yorkshire's West Riding, the history of Leeds can be traced to the 5th century, when the name referred to a wooded area of the Kingdom of Elmet. The name has been applied to many administrative entities over the centuries. It changed from being the name of a small manorial borough in the 13th century, through several incarnations, to being the name attached to the present metropolitan borough. In the 17th and 18th centuries Leeds became a major centre for the production and trading of wool. 

During the Industrial Revolution, Leeds developed into a major mill town; wool was the dominant industry but flax, engineering, iron foundries, printing, and other industries were important. From being a compact market town in the valley of the River Aire in the 16th century Leeds expanded and absorbed the surrounding villages to become a populous urban centre by the mid-20th century. Leeds has a population of around 781,700 (2016) making it the third largest city in the United Kingdom. The city lies within the United Kingdom's fourth-most populous urban area, with a population of 2.3 million. 

Today, Leeds has the most diverse economy of all the UK's main employment centres and has seen the fastest rate of private-sector jobs growth of any UK city and has the highest ratio of public to private sector jobs of all the UK's Core Cities. Leeds has the third-largest jobs total by local authority area with 480,000 in employment and self-employment at the beginning of 2015. Leeds is also ranked as a gamma world city by the Globalization and World Cities Research Network; and is considered the cultural, financial and commercial heart of the West Yorkshire Urban Area. Leeds is served by four universities, and has the fourth largest student population in the country and has the country's fourth largest urban economy. [Q:] What city referred to a wooded area?

Deep into the night, the bus pulled in to a Howard Johnson's restaurant and everybody got off the bus except Vingo. The young people began to wonder about him , trying to imagine his life. One of the girls sat beside him and introduced herself. After a long time, slowly and painfully, he began to tell his story. He had been in prison in prefix = st1 /New Yorkfor the last four years, and now he was going home. 

"Well, when I was in prison I wrote to my wife. I said, 'Martha, I understand if you can not stay married to me'. I said I was going to be away for a long time, and that if she couldn't stand it , if the kids kept asking questions, if it hurt her too much, well, she could just forget me . Get a new young man---she's a wonderful woman---and forget all about me. I told her she didn't have to write to me and she didn't. Not for the three and a half years." 

"Last week, when I was sure freedom was coming through, I wrote to her. I told her that if she had a new young man, I would understand. But if she didn't, if she would take me back, she should let me know. We used to live in the town,Brunswick, and there's a great big oak tree just as you come into the town. I told her if she would take me back, she should put a yellow handkerchief on the tree, and if she didn't want me, forgot me, no handkerchief and I'd keep going on through." 

Soon all the others were in it. When they were 20 miles fromBrunswick, the young men took over window seats on the right side, waiting for the approach of the great oak tree. Vingo stopped looking, tightening his face into the ex-con's mask. Then it was 10 miles, and then 5, and the bus became very quiet. 

Then suddenly all of the young people were up out of their seats, screaming and shouting and crying, doing small dances. All except Vingo. [Q:] What restaurant did the vehicle pull into?

Dhaka (, ; or ) is the capital and largest city of Bangladesh. The name of the city was spelled as "Dacca", which was an anglicisation name until the current spelling was adopted in 1983 to match with Bengali pronunciation. Located in an eponymous district and division, it lies along the east bank of the Buriganga River in the heart of the Bengal delta. The city is a microcosm of the entire country, with diverse religious and ethnic communities. Dhaka is the economic, cultural and political center of Bangladesh. It is a major financial center of South Asia. It is one of the world's most populated cities and within OIC countries, with a population of 17 million people in the Greater Dhaka Area. It is also the 4th most densely populated city in the world. 

At the height of its medieval glory, Dhaka was regarded as one of the wealthiest and most prosperous cities in the world. It served as the capital of the Bengal province of the Mughal Empire twice (1608–39 and 1660–1704). The city's name was Jahangir Nagar ("City of Jahangir") in the 17th century. It was central to the economy of Mughal Bengal, which generated 50% of Mughal GDP. It was a cosmopolitan commercial center and the hub of the worldwide muslin and silk trade.

Stephen Colbert plays a dangerous game. 

He walks a tightrope every night, and it's amazing that he doesn't fall on a regular basis. He tells jokes about race, gender, class and people love him or hate him. Does everyone get a joke? No. But of course he does say, in persona, amazingly offensive things sometimes. 

Last week things went south, and Twitter exploded in calls to #CancelColbert. 

The offense? A 140-character long foot-in-the-mouth that came from the Twitter feed @ColbertReport. The tweet was a joke that played off of a show segment that mocked an attempt by the owner of the Washington Redskins to make peace with the Native American community without having to change the team's name. 

"I'm willing to show the #Asian community I care by introducing the Ching-Chong Ding-Dong Foundation for Sensitivity to Orientals or Whatever." 

Race, meet satire. But it didn't work. 

The controversial tweet, it turns out, was not written by Colbert himself, or from anyone on his show. But it was a Comedy Central account that presumably had license from the show's producers to publicize and magnify Colbert's voice. 

But instead of repudiating the tweet, Colbert on Monday night made further jokes about how the incident almost silenced "my message of core conservative principles mixed with youth-friendly product placement." 

Following the lead of Asian-American activist Suey Park, some have been demanding that "The Colbert Report" be canceled. These words perpetuate hateful stereotypes and bring up a history of very public repression and personal shame. To use them now is to call forth that history. And in calling it forth, these words create more racism.  [Q:] what hash tag is mentioned? [A:] #Asian  [Q:] any others? [A:] #CancelColbert.  [Q:] who is that one about [A:] Stephen Colbert.  [Q:] does he have a show? [A:] "The Colbert Report"  [Q:] was is the social media account named in the story? [A:] @ColbertReport.  [Q:] what platform is that on? [A:] Twitter  [Q:] did they say something offensive? [A:] Yes  [Q:] what? [A:] "I'm willing to show the #Asian community I care by introducing the Ching-Chong Ding-Dong Foundation for Sensitivity to Orientals or Whatever."  [Q:] did colbert say that? [A:] No  [Q:] who did?

A boy was trying to pick out what instrument that he wanted to play. His parents wanted him to pick a good one because playing an instrument was very important to them. So, the boy went to a music store with his parents. When he got there he didn't know where to start, so the boy walked up to the front and asked the man who worked there for help. First the worker brought the boy to a piano. "No way," said the boy, "that looks way too hard!" The worker laughed at this, and then brought out a guitar. The boy thought that guitars were too popular and wanted to play something that not many other people would play. Finally, the worker brought the boy to the drums. "That's it! That is a cool instrument that I could really get into." However, his mom wasn't so happy with this because she thought that he would be too loud. The boy's dad stepped in and talked her into it because he knew that if the boy liked what he did, he would do way better. Twenty years later, and the boy was the drummer in a band.

New Jersey is a state in the Northeastern and mid-Atlantic regions of the United States. It is a peninsula, bordered on the north and east by the state of New York; on the east, southeast, and south by the Atlantic Ocean; on the west by the Delaware River and Pennsylvania; and on the southwest by the Delaware Bay and Delaware. New Jersey is the fourth-smallest state by area but the 11th-most populous and the most densely populated of the 50 U.S. states. New Jersey lies entirely within the combined statistical areas of New York City and Philadelphia and is the third-wealthiest state by median household income as of 2016. 

New Jersey was inhabited by Native Americans for more than 2,800 years, with historical tribes such as the Lenape along the coast. In the early 17th century, the Dutch and the Swedes made the first European settlements in the state. The English later seized control of the region, naming it the Province of New Jersey after the largest of the Channel Islands, Jersey, and granting it as a colony to Sir George Carteret and John Berkeley, 1st Baron Berkeley of Stratton. New Jersey was the site of several decisive battles during the American Revolutionary War in the 18th century. [Q:] Who inhabited NJ first [A:] Native Americans.

Terry is a normal human boy who enjoys football and playing with his toys. What makes him different is that he really enjoys talking to his magical reindeer Max. One day, Terry is walking around town with Max, and as they pass by the nearby farm, the farmer who owns the land calls out to them - "Hey! You, over there!" They quickly turn around, not sure if they are the ones being called to, but seeing no one nearby, they walk over to the farmer. "What do you need, sir?" Terry asks. "I need help with the plants; they're growing faster than normal. Can you help with the potato plants?" the farmer asks. "Sure! Let's help out, Max!" Terry happily answers. They end up spending the rest of the day helping, and are paid well, both in potatoes, carrots and money, for their work. "That was fun!" Terry says to Max, as they head home.

A fish that lives in America can live out. of water for months at a time, similar to how animals got used to land millions of years ago, a new study shows. The Mangrove Rivulus, a kind of little fish, lives in small pools of water. When their living place dries up, they live. on the land, said Scott Taylor, a researcher in Florida. The fish can grow as large as three inches. They group together and breathe air through their skin before they can find water again. The new scientific discovery came during a trip. "We were travelling for fun. and one day I kicked over a log and the fish came out," Taylor told reporters by telephone. He said he would make his study on the fish known to the public in an American magazine early next year. In lab tests, Taylor said he found the fish can live up to 66 days out of water without eating. Some other fish can live out of water for a short period of time. The walking catfish found in Southeast Asia can stay on land for hours at a time, while lungfish found in Australia, Africa and South America can live out of water, but only in a not active way. But no other known fish can be out of water as long as the Mangrove Rivulus and keep active, according to Patricia Wright, a biologist at a Canadian University. More studies of the fish may tell how animals changed over time. "These animals live in conditions similar to those millions of years ago, when animals began to move from water onto land," Wright said. [Q:] What kind of fish can live on land? [A:] The Mangrove Rivulus  [Q:] When does it do that? [A:] When their living place dries up  [Q:] How big are they? [A:] three inches.  [Q:] Can any other fish live on land?

A new study suggests that early exposure to germs strengthens the immune system. That means letting children get a little dirty might be good for their health later in life. 

The study involved laboratory mice. It found that adult mice raised in a germ-free environment were more likely to develop allergies, asthma and other autoimmune disorders. There are more than eighty disorders where cells that normally defend the body instead attack tissues and organs. 

Richard Blumberg,who led the study,is a professor at Harvard Medical School in Boston,Massachusetts. He says,in 1989,medical researchers who sought to explain these diseases, first discovered that the increasing use of antibacterial soaps and other products, especially early in life, could weaken immune systems. 

Now, Dr. Blumberg and his team have what is the first biological evidence to link early exposure to germs to stronger adult immune systems. They say this exposure could prevent the development of some autoimmune diseases. 

In the adult germ-free mice, they found that inflammation in the lungs and colon was caused by so-called killer T cells. These normally fight infection. But they became overactive and targeted healthy tissue--an autoimmune condition seen in asthma and a disease called ulcerative colitis . 

Dr. Blumberg says the mice raised in a normal environment did not have the same reaction. He says their immune systems had been "educated" by early exposure to germs. 

Rates of autoimmune disorders are rising worldwide, but mostly in wealthier, industrialized countries. According to Dr. Blumberg, it might be high time that people were warned to be more careful with the early use of antibiotics and the prescription from their doctors. 

Rob Dunn is a professor of ecology and evolutionary biology at North Carolina State University in Raleigh. He says the new study does not mean people should stop washing. "Wash your hands , but don't do it with antibacterial soap. Let your kids play in a reasonable amount of dirt and get outside and get exposed to a diversity of things", says Rob Dunn. [Q:] Are kids getting dirty a good thing? [A:] yes  [Q:] why? [A:] early exposure to germs strengthens the immune system  [Q:] Where kids tested in the study? [A:] no  [Q:] What was? [A:] laboratory mice  [Q:] What was found? [A:] adult mice raised in a germ-free environment were more likely to develop allergies, asthma and other autoimmune disorders  [Q:] Who led the study?

[A:] germs  [Q:] What type of enviornment were the mice raised in? [A:] germ-free  [Q:] Did they raise others in a germ envirnment? [A:] yes  [Q:] Was there a difference in the two? [A:] yes  [Q:] Was it the same reaction? [A:] no  [Q:] What caused inflammation in the lungs? [A:] killer T cells  [Q:] So, should we stop washing our kids? [A:] no  [Q:] Who says? [A:] Rob Dunn  [Q:] What should we do? [A:] Wash your hands , but don't do it with antibacterial soap  [Q:] and what else? [A:] Let kids play in a reasonable amount of dirt  [Q:] So they are exposed to what? [A:] a diversity of things  [Q:] What could weaken the immune system? [A:] increasing use of antibacterial soaps
Slate is an online magazine that covers current affairs, politics, and culture in the United States from a liberal perspective. It was created in 1996 by former "New Republic" editor Michael Kinsley, initially under the ownership of Microsoft as part of MSN. On December 21, 2004, it was purchased by The Washington Post Company, later renamed the Graham Holdings Company. Since June 4, 2008, "Slate" has been managed by The Slate Group, an online publishing entity created by the Graham Holdings Company to develop and manage web-only magazines. "Slate" is based in New York City, with an additional office in Washington, D.C. 

A French version "(slate.fr)" was launched in February 2009 by a group of four journalists, including Jean-Marie Colombani, Eric Leser, and economist Jacques Attali. Among them, the founders hold 50% in the publishing company, while The Slate Group holds 15%. In 2011, "slate.fr" started a separate site covering African news, "Slate Afrique", with a Paris-based editorial staff. 

In July 2014, Julia Turner replaced David Plotz, who had been editor of "Slate" since 2008. Plotz had been the deputy editor to Jacob Weisberg, "Slate's" editor from 2002 until his designation as the chairman and editor-in-chief of The Slate Group.

CHAPTER IX--GONE OVER TO THE ENEMY 



"Can I teach thee, my beloved? can I teach thee?" E. B. BROWNING. 

Agatha came home in due time, and Magdalen sent her sister to meet her at the station, where they found a merry Clipstone party in the waggonette waiting for Gillian, who was to come home at the same time. There was so much discussion of the new golf ground, that Vera had hardly a hand or a glance to bestow on Mr. Delrio, who jumped out of the same train, shook hands with Agatha, and bestirred himself in finding her luggage and calling a cab. 

"How he is improved! What a pleasing, gentlemanly fellow he looks!" she exclaimed, as she waved her thanks, while driving off in the cab. 

"Is he not?" said Paula, while Vera bridled and blushed. "You will be delighted with his work. I never saw anything more lovely than little St. Cyriac the martyr." 

"He is taken from Mrs. Henderson's little boy," added Vera; "such a dear little darling." 

"And his mother is to be done; indeed, he has sketched her for St. Juliet." 

"Flapsy! St. Romeo, too, I suppose?" 

"Nonsense, Nag! There really was a St. Juliet or Julitta, and she was his mother, and they both were martyrs. I will tell you all the history," began Paula; but Agatha interposed. 

"You must like having him down here. Sister must be much pleased with him. She used to like old Mr. Delrio." 

"Well, we have not said much about him," owned Paula. "He does not seem to wish it, or expect to be in with swells."  [Q:] Who's the top quote by? [A:] E. B. BROWNING.  [Q:] Who arrived just in time?

(CNN) -- A man who lost both legs in the Boston Marathon attack is engaged to the woman he was waiting for at the finish line. 

Jeff Bauman, 28, is also expected a child this summer with fiancee Erin Hurley, 27, according to an announcement on his foundation's Facebook page: 

"We are so happy to share with you exciting news that has happened over the last few months...Jeff and Erin became engaged and are expecting their first child in the summer!!! Congratulations Jeff and Erin!!" 

The posting did not reveal a due date for the child or a wedding date. 

Bauman is credited with helping investigators identify the suspects in the April 15, 2013, double bombing. 

The image of the maimed Bauman being led to safety by a man in a cowboy hat became one of the most memorable images of the Boston Marathon terrorist attack that killed three and injured more than 260 people. 

A day after he woke up from two life-saving surgeries with no legs, he mustered the strength to describe bombing suspect Tamerlan Tsarnaev to law enforcement. 

Tsarnaev's younger brother, Dzhokhar, has pleaded not guilty to 30 federal charges related the bombings, including murder. Tamerlan Tsarnaev was killed when his brother ran over him as police were trying to handcuff him in a chase a few days later, authorities said. 

Bauman announced in September that he will publish a memoir -- titled "Stronger" -- about his experiences at and since the marathon. 

"The past months have often been difficult, but the support I've received from around the world, and especially from the people of Boston, has inspired me to set and achieve high goals," he said in a statement released by Grand Central Publishing last year.

Princess Ellen wanted nothing more than to be a singer when she grew up. She had a beautiful voice and everyone who heard it said she was the best singer in the land. But her uncle believed singing would keep her from her job as princess, so he found a witch and paid her to steal Princess Ellen's voice. The witch made a spell which gave Ellen the witch's voice. The spell also gave Ellen's voice to the witch. The witch went on to become famous as a singer, and Ellen grew up to be Queen. One day Queen Ellen heard of a singer who was the best in the land. She went to hear this singer, and was surprised to hear her own voice coming from the woman on stage. When the show was over, Ellen found the singer and gave her a penny.

Once upon a time, there was a squirrel named Joey. Joey loved to go outside and play with his cousin Jimmy. Joey and Jimmy played silly games together, and were always laughing. One day, Joey and Jimmy went swimming together at their Aunt Julie's pond. Joey woke up early in the morning to eat some food before they left. He couldn't find anything to eat except for pie! Usually, Joey would eat cereal, fruit (a pear), or oatmeal for breakfast. After he ate, he and Jimmy went to the pond. On their way there they saw their friend Jack Rabbit. They dove into the water and swam for several hours. The sun was out, but the breeze was cold. Joey and Jimmy got out of the water and started walking home. Their fur was wet, and the breeze chilled them. When they got home, they dried off, and Jimmy put on his favorite purple shirt. Joey put on a blue shirt with red and green dots. The two squirrels ate some food that Joey's mom, Jasmine, made and went off to bed. [Q:] what kind of animal was joey [A:] a squirrel  [Q:] what was his cousin's name [A:] Jimmy  [Q:] Were they happy? [A:] yes  [Q:] Where did they go? [A:] outside  [Q:] Then where?

George Washington Carver showed that plant life was more than just food for animals and humans. Carver's first step was to analyze plant parts to find out what they were made of. He then combined these simpler isolated substances with other substances to create new products. 

The branch of chemistry that studies and finds ways to use raw materials from farm products to make industrial products is called chemurgy. Carver was one of the first and greatest chemurgists of all time. Today the science of chemurgy is better known as the science of synthetics . Each day people depend on and use synthetics made from raw materials. All his life Carver battled against the disposal of waste materials, and warned of the growing need to develop substitutes for the natural substances being used up by humans. 

Carver never cared about getting credit for the new products he created. He never tried to patent his discoveries or get wealthy from them. He turned down many offers to leave Tuskegee Institute to become a scientist in private industry. Thomas Edison, inventor of the electric light, offered him a laboratory in Detroit to carry out food research. When the United States government made him a collaborator in the Mycology and Plant Disease Survey of the Department of Agriculture, he accepted the position with the understanding that he wouldn't leave Tuskegee. An authority on plant disease--especially of the fungus variety--Carver sent hundreds of specimens to the United States Department of Agriculture. At the peak of his career, Carver's fame and influence were known on every continent. [Q:] What branch of Chemistry seeks ways to use raw materials to make industrial products? [A:] chemurgy.  [Q:] Where do these raw materials originate from? [A:] farm products  [Q:] What is chemurgy called today? [A:] the science of synthetics  [Q:] What was Carver's full name?

When I was young, I went looking for gold in California. I never found enough to make a rich strike. But I did discover a beautiful part of the country called Stanislau. Like Heaven on Earth, it had bright green hills and deep forests where soft winds touched the trees. By the time I arrived, the charming paradise had been deserted because miners' good luck didn't last. 

Then, I realized I was not alone after all. 

A man was smiling at me as he stood in front of his little house. Its front yard was full of blue and yellow flowers. White curtains hung from the windows and floated in the soft summer wind. 

Still smiling, the man invited me inside. My spirit seemed to come to life again. I saw a bright rug on the shining wooden floor. And on little tables there were seashells, books and china vases full of flowers. A woman had made this house into a home. The joy in my heart showed on my face. The man read my thoughts. "All her work." He said affectionately, "Nothing here hasn't felt the touch of her hand." 

One picture on the wall was not hanging straight. He went to fix it. He stepped back several times to make sure the picture was straight. Then he gave it a gentle touch. "She always does that," he explained, "It is like the finishing pat a mother gives her child's hair after she has brushed it. I don't know why I do it. I just do it." 

As he talked, I went to a little black-walnut shelf that held a small picture of the most beautiful creature I had ever seen. There was a sweetness and softness in the woman's expression. The man stared at the picture. "Nineteen her last birthday. That was the day we married. When you see her...ah, just wait until you meet her!" "Where is she now?" I asked. "Oh, she is away visiting her parents. This is Wednesday," he said slowly. "She will be back on Saturday, in the evening." 

That night, I stayed. The man told me his name was Henry. 

Thursday evening we had two visitors, Tom and Joe. "We just drop over to ask when little madam is coming home. Any news from her?" "Oh yes," the man replied. "A letter." He took a yellowed letter out of his wallet and read it. It was full of loving messages. While reading, he glimpsed his friends and cried out, "Oh no, you are doing it again, Tom! Take your hands away and let me see your eyes. I'm going to tell her this time!" "No, you mustn't do that, Henry," the grey-haired miner said. "I am getting old. And any little sorrow makes me cry. Lord, we miss her so." 

Saturday finally came. 

I was glad to see his two friends, Tom and Joe, with guitars, coming down the road as the sun began to set. They put the flowers they brought in vases and began to play some fast and lively songs. 

Henry's friends kept giving him glasses of whiskey. When I reached for one of the two remaining glasses, Tom stopped my arm. "Drop that! Take the other." he whispered. I did so. Henry was served last. He had hardly swallowed his drink when the clock struck midnight. His face grew paler and paler. "Boys," he said, "I am sick with fear. Help! I want to lie down." Henry was asleep almost before the words were out of his mouth. 

In a moment, those handy men had his clothes off and tucked him into his bed. They seemed to be getting ready to leave. So I said, "Please don't go, gentlemen. She won't know me. I am a stranger." They glanced at each other. Then Joe said, "She? Poor thing, she's been dead nineteen years!" "Dead?" I whispered. "That or worse." he said. 

"She went to see her folks half a year after she got married. On her way back, on a Saturday evening in June, when she was almost here, the Indians captured her. She's never been heard of since. Henry _ . He thinks she is still alive. When June comes, he thinks she has gone on her trip to see her parents. Then he begins to wait for her to come back. We drop in here, three days before she's due, to encourage him up and listen to him read the letter. On Saturday we all come and get everything ready for a dance. We've done it for nineteen years. The first Saturday there were twenty-seven of us, but only two now. We drug him to sleep through the night. Then he's all right for another year." 

The two old men opened the door and disappeared into the darkness of Stanislau. [Q:] Where was the man standing? [A:] in front of his house  [Q:] What was his name? [A:] Henry.  [Q:] Did he have any friends? [A:] yes  [Q:] How many? [A:] two  [Q:] What are their names? [A:] Tom and Joe  [Q:] Did the narrator go into the man's house? [A:] yes  [Q:] What covered the floor?

CHAPTER XXXVI 

THE CHARLATAN UNMASKED 

There seemed for the next few minutes to be a somewhat singular abstention from any desire to interfere with the two people who stood in the centre of the little group, hand-in-hand. Saton, after his first speech, and after Lois had given him her hands, had turned a little defiantly toward Rochester, who remained, however, unmoved, his elbow resting upon the broad mantelpiece, his face almost expressionless. Vandermere, too, stood on one side and held his peace, though the effort with which he did so was a visible one. Lady Mary looked anxiously towards them. Pauline had shrunk back, as though something in the situation terrified her. 

Even Saton himself felt that it was the silence before the storm. The courage which he had summoned up to meet a storm of disapproval, began to ebb slowly away in the face of this unnatural silence. It was clear that the onus of further speech was to rest with him. 

Still retaining Lois' hand, he turned toward Rochester. 

"You have forbidden me to enter your house, or to hold any communication with your ward until she was of age, Mr. Rochester," he said. "One of your conditions I have obeyed. With regard to the other, I have done as I thought fit. However, to-day she is her own mistress. She has consented to be my wife. I do not need to ask for your consent or approval. If you are not willing that she should be married from your roof, I can take her at once to the Comtesse, who is prepared to receive her."  [Q:] Who felt there was a silence before the storm? [A:] Even Saton  [Q:] Who stood in the centre of the little group? [A:] Saton and Lois  [Q:] Whose elbow was on the mantelpiece? [A:] Rochester  [Q:] Who looked anxiously at them?

Andrew waited for his granddaddy to show up. They were going fishing. His mom had packed them a lunch. She had made Peanut Butter and Jelly Sandwiches. She also packed a bottle of nice cool water to drink. Andrew had wanted something else for lunch. He wanted chicken or cold cuts or left over meat loaf, but his mom sent Peanut Butter and Jelly sandwiches. The best way to get to the river was along the path. When the path ended, they needed to go through the bushes to the river. On some days they would think about going another way. They could go over the bridge, or through the back of the house or through Uncle Tom's yard. Today they took the path to the river. Andrew found some animal poop along the path. He asked his Grandpa what kind of animal poop he had found. He wanted to know if it was a lion, a tiger or a bear that had made the poop. Grandpa pointed in the bushes. Andrew saw a small black and white animal looking at him with big eyes. Andrew knew that he had was looking at a raccoon. He was sure that the raccoon had made the poop. When Andrew and Grandpa got to the river they put their fishing poles into the water. Andrew caught his first fish right away. He caught a second fish before lunch. He got hungry and had his Peanut Butter and Jelly sandwich and cool water. He saw that Grandpa had fallen asleep. After eating his lunch, Andrew caught three more fish before he woke up his grandpa. When Andrew and Grandpa got back home they gave all the fish they had caught to Andrew's mother, so she could make a good dinner. [Q:] What was Andrew waiting for? [A:] His granddaddy.  [Q:] Why? [A:] Because they were going fishing.  [Q:] What did his mom do? [A:] Packed them a lunch  [Q:] of what? [A:] Peanut Butter and Jelly Sandwiches and a bottle of nice cool water.  [Q:] Did he like it? [A:] No.  [Q:] What did he want? [A:] Chicken or cold cuts or left over meat loaf.  [Q:] How did they get to the river? [A:] Along the path.  [Q:] where there other ways? [A:] Yes.

CHAPTER XXIII 

A SLIDE DOWN THE MOUNTAIN SIDE 

"My gracious, Dick! It sure is snowing some now!" 

"Yes, and it is getting colder every minute." 

"If we don't get out of the mountains putty quick we'll be snowed in," came from Jack Wumble. 

"Did you calkerlate to git back to Dawson afore winter sot in?" inquired Ike Furner, curiously. 

"Why of course!" cried Sam. 

"I don't see how you are goin' to make it." 

"Oh, we must get back," said Dick. "If only we could find Tom," he added, with a sigh. 

It was fully an hour after they had left the campfire at the entrance to the cave of the mountain. They had walked to the chasm where they thought Tom might have had a tumble and crossed and recrossed it several times. But they had found no traces of the missing Rover boy. 

"If only we knew whether he went down in that opening!" said Sam, for at least the tenth time. "Dick, do you suppose we can climb down into it?" 

"Not without a rope, Sam. The sides are too steep and slippery." 

Time and again they called down. But no answer came back. If Tom was down there he was either unconscious or dead. 

And now it had begun to snow harder than ever. The air was so full of the white flakes that they could not see ten feet in any direction. It was a typical Alaskan snowstorm. There was a sweep to the wind that found the very marrow of their bones.  [Q:] Who says it's getting cold? [A:] Dick  [Q:] Is it snowing? [A:] yes  [Q:] What will happen if they stay? [A:] they will be snowed in  [Q:] Who says this? [A:] Wumble  [Q:] What is his first name? [A:] Jack  [Q:] How long did it take them to get to their destination?

[A:] Tom  [Q:] What would have been helpful to know? [A:] whether he went down in the opening  [Q:] Who says this? [A:] Sam  [Q:] Did he say it once? [A:] no  [Q:] After how many times? [A:] at least ten  [Q:] What does he suggest? [A:] climb into the opening  [Q:] Can they? [A:] no  [Q:] Says who? [A:] Dick  [Q:] Why not? [A:] they don't have a rope  [Q:] What do they do then? [A:] they called down  [Q:] Does anyone respond? [A:] no
CHAPTER X 

After nearly a year's captivity, the King engaged to pay a ransom, and, until the terms could be arranged, his two sons were to be placed as hostages in the hands of the Normans, whilst he returned to his own domains. The Princes were to be sent to Bayeux; whither Richard had returned, under the charge of the Centevilles, and was now allowed to ride and walk abroad freely, provided he was accompanied by a guard. 

"I shall rejoice to have Carloman, and make him happy," said Richard; "but I wish Lothaire were not coming." 

"Perhaps," said good Father Lucas, "he comes that you may have a first trial in your father's last lesson, and Abbot Martin's, and return good for evil." 

The Duke's cheek flushed, and he made no answer. 

He and Alberic betook themselves to the watch-tower, and, by and by, saw a cavalcade approaching, with a curtained vehicle in the midst, slung between two horses. "That cannot be the Princes," said Alberic; "that must surely be some sick lady." 

"I only hope it is not the Queen," exclaimed Richard, in dismay. "But no; Lothaire is such a coward, no doubt he was afraid to ride, and she would not trust her darling without shutting him up like a demoiselle. But come down, Alberic; I will say nothing unkind of Lothaire, if I can help it." 

Richard met the Princes in the court, his sunny hair uncovered, and bowing with such becoming courtesy, that Fru Astrida pressed her son's arm, and bade him say if their little Duke was not the fairest and noblest child in Christendom.  [Q:] What was the King to pay? [A:] a ransom  [Q:] What would happen to his sons? [A:] they would be hostages  [Q:] In whose hands? [A:] the Normans  [Q:] Where were they to go?

And it is the biggest movie theater in the city . It has the most comfortable seats and the best sound . She likes watching movies there. Last Sunday, I took her to Movie World to watch the movie Epic . Epic is a movie about a father Bomba and his 17-year-old daughter Mary. Bomba was interested in looking for Leaf Men. He said they lived in a forest, but no one believed him. One day , Mary was swept into the world of the Leaf Men, and she found her father was right. At this early-afternoon showing, the theater was almost full. 60% of the _ were kids aged three to ten and their fathers. I didn't think it was because of the movie itself. In fact, a study showed that dads were 50% more likely than moms to take young kids to the movies in the United States. ,. [Q:] who is the author ? [A:] James  [Q:] last name ?

CHAPTER XVII 

THE MAN AT THE ASTOR 

Refraining from discussing with Master Maloney the alleged bone-headedness of girls, Smith went through into the inner room, and found John sitting in the editorial chair, glancing through the latest number of _Peaceful Moments_. 

"Why, John, friend of my youth," he said, "where have you been hiding all this time? I called you up at your office weeks ago, and an acid voice informed me that you were no longer there. Have you been fired?" 

"Yes," said John. "Why aren't you on the _News_ any more? Nobody seemed to know where you were, till I met Faraday this morning, who told me you were here." 

Smith was conscious of an impression that in some subtle way John had changed since their last meeting. For a moment he could not have said what had given him this impression. Then it flashed upon him. Before, John had always been, like Mrs. Fezziwig in "The Christmas Carol," one vast substantial smile. He had beamed cheerfully on what to him was evidently the best of all possible worlds. Now, however, it would seem that doubts had occurred to him as to the universal perfection of things. His face was graver. His eyes and his mouth alike gave evidence of disturbing happenings. 

In the matter of confidences, Smith was not a believer in spade-work. If they were offered to him, he was invariably sympathetic, but he never dug for them. That John had something on his mind was obvious, but he intended to allow him, if he wished to reveal it, to select his own time for the revelation.  [Q:] Did John used to be something of an optimist? [A:] Yes  [Q:] Who had he been like? [A:] Mrs. Fezziwig in "The Christmas Carol"  [Q:] Is that a novel? [A:] unknown  [Q:] Did John smile a lot? [A:] Yes  [Q:] Does he still believe in the universal perfection of things? [A:] No  [Q:] What had now occurred to him? [A:] Doubts  [Q:] And his face is now what? [A:] Graver  [Q:] What tidings does he likely bring news of? [A:] Disturbing happenings.  [Q:] Is Smith someone who likes to try to gossip? [A:] No  [Q:] Was Smith going to press John to reveal anything before he was ready? [A:] No  [Q:] Who had John met that morning? [A:] Faraday  [Q:] Where had he missed seeing Smith? [A:] At the News  [Q:] Did anyone before Faraday seem to know where Smith had been? [A:] No  [Q:] Had John been fired from his job? [A:] Have yoYesu been fired?" "Yes,"  [Q:] How long has he and Smith known each other? [A:] Since Smith's youth  [Q:] Did John do an outside job, like construction? [A:] No  [Q:] What did he work in, then? [A:] As an editor  [Q:] Was the person who informed Smith of John's firing very friendly? [A:] No  [Q:] What was John reading when Smith found him?

CHAPTER 28 

The Fenian adventure furnished the distraction which Lothair required It broke that absorbing spell of sentiment which is the delicious but enervating privilege of the youthful heart; yet, when Lothair woke in the morning from his well-earned slumbers, the charm returned, and he fell at once into a reverie of Belmont, and a speculation when he might really pay his first visit there. Not to-day--that was clearly out of the question. They had separated only yesterday, and yet it seemed an age, and the adventure of another world. There are moods of feeling which defy alike time and space. 

But on the morrow, Friday, he might venture to go. But, then, would to-morrow ever come? It seemed impossible. How were the intervening hours to pass? The world, however, was not so devoid of resources as himself, and had already appropriated his whole day. And, first, Monsignore Catesby came to breakfast with him, talking of every thing that was agreeable or interesting, but in reality bent on securing his presence at the impending ecclesiastical ceremony of high import, where his guardian was to officiate, and where the foundation was to be laid of the reconciliation of all churches in the bosom of the true one. Then, in the afternoon, Lothair had been long engaged to a match of pigeon-shooting, in which pastime Bertram excelled. It seemed there was to be a most exciting sweepstakes to-day, in which the flower of England were to compete; Lothair among them, and for the first time.  [Q:] How long had they been apart? [A:] Since yesterday  [Q:] Did it seem like a lot longer? [A:] Yes  [Q:] Who did he eat with? [A:] Monsignore Catesby  [Q:] Which meal? [A:] Breakfast  [Q:] What did they talk about?

Myocardial infarction (MI) or acute myocardial infarction (AMI), commonly known as a heart attack, occurs when blood flow stops to a part of the heart causing damage to the heart muscle. The most common symptom is chest pain or discomfort which may travel into the shoulder, arm, back, neck, or jaw. Often it is in the center or left side of the chest and lasts for more than a few minutes. The discomfort may occasionally feel like heartburn. Other symptoms may include shortness of breath, nausea, feeling faint, a cold sweat, or feeling tired. About 30% of people have atypical symptoms, with women more likely than men to present atypically. Among those over 75 years old, about 5% have had an MI with little or no history of symptoms. An MI may cause heart failure, an irregular heartbeat, or cardiac arrest. 

Most MIs occur due to coronary artery disease. Risk factors include high blood pressure, smoking, diabetes, lack of exercise, obesity, high blood cholesterol, poor diet, and excessive alcohol intake, among others. The mechanism of an MI often involves the complete blockage of a coronary artery caused by a rupture of an atherosclerotic plaque. MIs are less commonly caused by coronary artery spasms, which may be due to cocaine, significant emotional stress, and extreme cold, among others. A number of tests are useful to help with diagnosis, including electrocardiograms (ECGs), blood tests, and coronary angiography. An ECG may confirm an ST elevation MI if ST elevation is present. Commonly used blood tests include troponin and less often creatine kinase MB. [Q:] What can a heart attack symptom feel like? [A:] heartburn  [Q:] Which symptom? [A:] chest pain  [Q:] Can this pain travel? [A:] yes  [Q:] Does it go to the lower part of the body? [A:] no  [Q:] What about the jaw? [A:] yes  [Q:] The shoulder and arm?

Throughout time, people have loved music for its ability to transport them into a world of rhythm and melody. Recently more and more hospitals and clinics have been _ the power of music -not only to comfort patients, but to help cure them as well. Welcome to the world of music therapy . 

After each of the two world wars, musicians visited hospitals and played instruments for injured soldiers suffering from emotional and physical pain. Today's music therapists continue this practice, playing instruments such as guitars and harps to bring comfort to their audiences. 

Therapist Eric Mammen encourages his patients at a children's hospital to participate with him as he plays. During visits with 13-year-old cancer patient Lawrence Garcia, Mammen encourages Garcia to beat on electric drums while he plays the guitar. The therapy won't cure his cancer, but it does, according to Garcia's mom, take away much of the boy's depression . 

Music therapy can put patients in better moods and ease the symptoms of depression according to the American Music Therapy Association. Other benefits include relieving pain, calming tension, aiding sleep, reducing worry or fear, and easing muscle tension. 

Jose Haro personally experienced the benefits of music therapy when he was recovering from heart surgery. During his recovery, he played a piano whose keys lit up, indicating which keys to touch to play along with the background music. Soon he was playing tunes and noticing something strange. "I was searching for my pain." He says of his experience, "but it was gone." 

While Haro's experience provides an evidence of the power of music to relieve pain, scientific research has proven music also helps patients with Alzheimer's disease and arthritis. 

In addition, music therapy helps premature babies. Doctors are tapping into a powerful way to teach premature babies that haven't yet learned how to suck. Doctors use a device that comforts the babies by playing music when they suck on a pacifier . Soon the babies learn to suck in return for music, gaining weight faster and going home earlier than those who do not use the device. 

Even perfectly healthy people are discovering the power of music to calm and heal. Drum circles attract people who find stress relief in beating out rhythms. While music is not a cure-all, it does make life a little easier. [Q:] What profession is Eric Mammen in? [A:] Therapist  [Q:] Who does he encourage? [A:] patients at a children's hospital  [Q:] What does he encourage them to do with him? [A:] play instruments  [Q:] How old is Lawrence Garcia? [A:] 13  [Q:] What's he dying of?

The designer of the Apple Computer, Steve Jobs, was not quite successful in his early years. He was not among the best students at school, and from time to time he got into trouble with either his schoolmates or his teachers. But he was full of new ideas, which few people saw the _ of. Things remained the same when he went up to college and he dropped out halfway. Steve Jobs worked first as a video game designer at Atari. He worked there for only a few months and then he set out to tour India. He hoped that the trip would give him more ideas and give him a change in life for the better. After he returned from India, he begin to live on a farm in California. And then, in 1975, Steve Jobs set about making a new type of computer. Along with his friend Stephen Wozniak, he designed the Apple Computer in his bedroom and built it in his garage . He gave the name "Apple" because it reminded him of a happy summer he once on an orchard in Oregon. His Apple Computer was so successful that Steve Jobs soon became worldwide famous. But unluckily, he died of illness in 2011. [Q:] Who is the main character? [A:] Steve Jobs  [Q:] What did he design? [A:] Apple Computer  [Q:] Was he successful in his early years?

Since 1901, the Nobel Prize in Literature () has been awarded annually to an author from any country who has, in the words of the will of Alfred Nobel, produced "in the field of literature the most outstanding work in an ideal direction" (original Swedish: "den som inom litteraturen har producerat det mest framstående verket i en idealisk riktning"). Though individual works are sometimes cited as being particularly noteworthy, here "work" refers to an author's work as a whole. The Swedish Academy decides who, if anyone, will receive the prize in any given year. The academy announces the name of the chosen laureate in early October. It is one of the five Nobel Prizes established by the will of Alfred Nobel in 1895; the others are the Nobel Prize in Chemistry, Nobel Prize in Physics, Nobel Peace Prize, and Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine. 

Although the Nobel Prize in Literature has become the world's most prestigious literature prize, the Swedish Academy has attracted significant criticism for its handling of the award. Many authors who have won the prize have fallen into obscurity, while others rejected by the jury remain widely studied and read, like Ruben Darío. The prize has "become widely seen as a political one - a peace prize in literary disguise", whose judges are prejudiced against authors with different political tastes to them. Tim Parks has expressed skepticism that it is possible for "Swedish professors ... [to] compar[e] a poet from Indonesia, perhaps translated into English with a novelist from Cameroon, perhaps available only in French, and another who writes in Afrikaans but is published in German and Dutch...". As of 2016, 16 of the 113 recipients have been of Scandinavian origin. The Academy has often been alleged to be biased towards European, and in particular Swedish, authors. Some, such as Indian academic Sabaree Mitra, have noted that, though the Nobel Prize in Literature is significant and tends to overshadow other awards, it is "not the only benchmark of literary excellence."

Annie was helping her little brother Max pick flowers from the garden. They wanted to put the flowers in a jar to put on the kitchen table. Mother's Day was the next day and their mother loved fresh flowers. 

After they picked flowers and put them in a jar, Max asked Annie if they could have a snack. Annie took Max into the kitchen and got out an apple to slice up. They sat down at the table looking at the flowers and ate their apple slices. There was a window in the kitchen that let in sunlight. 

"Hey!" Max said, pointing at one of the roses in the jar. "There's something moving on that rose." 

Annie looked more closely at the flowers. "It's a ladybug," she said. "We need to take it back outside." 

Suddenly the ladybug began flying around the kitchen. Max jumped up and ran around trying to catch it. At last he clapped his hands around it. "Careful!" said Annie.

(CNN) -- A high-speed car accident in Florida has left the teenage son of wrestling star Hulk Hogan seriously injured and a companion in critical condition late Sunday, police said. 

TV footage shows a person injured in Nick Hogan's car crash being treated in an ambulance. 

Nick Bollea, 17, was the driver of a Toyota Supra that went out of control while driving at a "high rate of speed" about 7:30 p.m. Sunday, said Wayne Shelor, a spokesman for the Clearwater police in Clearwater, Florida. 

The car "inexplicably left the roadway," jumped across a raised median and slammed into a palm tree just east of downtown, Shelor said. 

"It destroyed the car," he said. 

Firefighters had to extract Bollea and his passenger, whose identity was not immediately released, from the wreckage. Both were flown to a hospital in nearby St. Petersburg, Florida, Shelor said. 

"They're both down there. Nick's father is down there," he said. Watch Hulk Hogan on the scene with the mangled car » 

Hulk Hogan, one of the top professional wrestlers of the 1980s and 1990s, is now featured in the VH1 reality show "Hogan Knows Best." His son, wife Linda and daughter Brooke regularly appear on the show. 

One episode documented the son's interest in a type of high-speed car racing known as "drifting." 

Shelor said there was no evidence of drag racing or "drifting" in Sunday's wreck. 

Police said Bollea -- known to viewers as "Nick Hogan" -- was not as seriously hurt as his passenger, who was listed as critical.  [Q:] Where did this accident occur?

LONDON, England (CNN) -- Michael Jackson had a level of hero worship on a par with Elvis Presley or the Beatles but he was the first black star to inspire such a massive following around the world. 

Michael Jackson, the ultimate showman, craved attention and was rarely disappointed. 

Total worldwide sales of more than 350 million records over his 40-year career give just a hint of the adoration there was for the "King of Pop." The fact that his death came on the eve of a comeback tour in London will leave his devotees feeling even more bereft. 

While his career -- and wealth -- had waned greatly in recent years, there was still enough support for the concerts to sell out at a rate of nearly 40,000 an hour. Fans from as far afield as Japan, Germany and Dubai queued to buy their tickets. 

Steve Greenberg, founder and CEO of S-Curve Records, was a disc jockey in Tel Aviv, Israel, when "Thriller" first dropped and witnessed first-hand how Jackson became an international icon. 

His was a global appeal, Greenberg said, among fans and artists worldwide. 

"He was as big in the Middle East and Southeast Asia as he was in America and Europe," Greenberg said. "He had that universality that not many people had. The Beatles had it, Muhammad Ali had it, but not many other people have had it." 

Jackson was known for far more than his music though. Speaking after his death in Los Angeles was announced, U.S. civil rights campaigner Rev. Al Sharpton paid tribute to the work of a "trailblazer" in helping people around the world through his charities. How will you remember Michael Jackson?

Pictures That Don't Last "YEARS ago when I was at the Grand Canyon, I remember someone coming up to the canyon's edge, taking a shot with their camera and then walking away, like 'got it - done', barely even glancing at the magnificent scene sprawling in front of them," Linda Henkel, a scientist at Fairfield University, US told Live Science. Henkel was surprised by how obsessed people are with taking pictures these days - before dinner, during friends' birthday parties, on museum tours and so on.You know people just like that, don't you? They keep taking pictures because they think that it helps record the moment, but as Henkel's latest study has just found out, this obsession may prevent their brains from remembering what actually happened, reported The Guardian. In her study, Henkel led a group of college students around a museum and asked them to simply observe 15 objects and to photograph 15 others.The next day the students' memory of the tour was tested, and the results showed that they were less accurate in recognizing the objects and they remembered fewer details about them if they photographed them. "When people rely on technology to remember for them - counting on the camera to record the event and thus not needing to attend to it fully themselves, it can have a negative effect on how well they remember their experiences," Henkel explained. But there is also an exception: if students zoomed in to photograph part of an object, their memory actually improved, and those who focused the lens on a specific area could even recall parts that weren't in the frame. So basically, this study is saying that constantly taking pictures can harm your memory.But shouldn't reviewing pictures we have taken help wake up our memories? This is true, but only if we spend enough time doing it. "In order to remember, we have to access and interact with the photos, rather than just amassing them," Henkel told The Telegraph.However, previous research has shown that most people never take the time to look over their digital pictures simply because there are too many of them and they aren't usually very organized on their computers.

Super Bowl 50 was an American football game to determine the champion of the National Football League (NFL) for the 2015 season. The American Football Conference (AFC) champion Denver Broncos defeated the National Football Conference (NFC) champion Carolina Panthers 24–10 to earn their third Super Bowl title. The game was played on February 7, 2016, at Levi's Stadium in the San Francisco Bay Area at Santa Clara, California. As this was the 50th Super Bowl, the league emphasized the "golden anniversary" with various gold-themed initiatives, as well as temporarily suspending the tradition of naming each Super Bowl game with Roman numerals (under which the game would have been known as "Super Bowl L"), so that the logo could prominently feature the Arabic numerals 50. 

The Panthers finished the regular season with a 15–1 record, and quarterback Cam Newton was named the NFL Most Valuable Player (MVP). They defeated the Arizona Cardinals 49–15 in the NFC Championship Game and advanced to their second Super Bowl appearance since the franchise was founded in 1995. The Broncos finished the regular season with a 12–4 record, and denied the New England Patriots a chance to defend their title from Super Bowl XLIX by defeating them 20–18 in the AFC Championship Game. They joined the Patriots, Dallas Cowboys, and Pittsburgh Steelers as one of four teams that have made eight appearances in the Super Bowl.

Tom and Joseph are best friends. They spent their summer vacation in Africa. When they were walking through the desert , they started to argue about something. Tom became very angry and slapped Joseph in the face. Joseph felt hurt, but he didn't say anything to Tom. Then Joseph wrote in the sand : "Today my best friend slapped me in the face." They kept on walking until they found a small lake. They decided to have a bath . But when Joseph got in the water, he started to sink . Tom jumped in after him and pulled him out. His friend saved his life. After he became well again, Joseph wrote on a stone : "Today my best friend saved my life." Tom couldn't understand it. "After I hurt you, you wrote in the sand. Now you write on a stone. Why?" he asked. _ " Joseph answered. "But when someone does something good for us, we must write it on stones so that no wind can ever take it away."

For millions of years, sharks have been the kings of the oceans, the top of the food chain. But these days, the hunter has become the hunted, because of better methods from commercial fishermen who are looking for fins to make expensive soup sold mostly in Asia. Shark fins are far more valuable than shark meat, so fishermen cut the fins off live fish and throw the sharks overboard to maximize the catch they bring back. 

Shark finning is illegal in the United States, but there're tournament sport fishermen, who target and kill the biggest ones they take from the sea. These tournaments, the prizes of which can reach $5,000 or more, attract large crowds of anglers but also draw protests from animal rights groups and environmentalists. 

The competitors say they are enjoying a fun and legal sport, the impact on the overall shark population is very small, and most of the sharks caught are returned to the ocean. Dave Johnson, who is from Kennebunkport, Maine, said no one ever comes close to the limit set by the government of killing one shark per day during the three-month season. 

"I enjoy watching these animals, but I also enjoy catching and releasing them, and very rarely killing them and eating them," he said. "If I thought killing one shark was endangering the species and contributing to their decline I'd stop doing it tomorrow." 

That is exactly what marine biologists like Luke Tipple want to happen. "I believe that they should just stop it. In fact, we don't need to be targeting, in any way, any of these threatened populations," he said. Up to 73 million sharks are killed annually, and many species are at risk of extinction . [Q:] how many are killed annually? [A:] Up to 73 million  [Q:] According to who? [A:] Luke Tipple  [Q:] What is used in Asia? [A:] fins  [Q:] For? [A:] soup  [Q:] Who is Tipple?

CHAPTER XV 

For some time after the conclusion of the race, Bashti stood talking with his head men, Agno among them. Lenerengo was similarly engaged with several old cronies. As Jerry lay off to one side where she had forgotten him, the wild-dog he had bullied on the _Arangi_ came up and sniffed at him. At first he sniffed at a distance, ready for instant flight. Then he drew cautiously closer. Jerry watched him with smouldering eyes. At the moment wild-dog's nose touched him, he uttered a warning growl. Wild-dog sprang back and whirled away in headlong flight for a score of yards before he learned that he was not pursued. 

Again he came back cautiously, as it was the instinct in him to stalk wild game, crouching so close to the ground that almost his belly touched. He lifted and dropped his feet with the lithe softness of a cat, and from time to time glanced to right and to left as if in apprehension of some flank attack. A noisy outburst of boys' laughter in the distance caused him to crouch suddenly down, his claws thrust into the ground for purchase, his muscles tense springs for the leap he knew not in what direction, from the danger he knew not what that might threaten him. Then he identified the noise, know that no harm impended, and resumed his stealthy advance on the Irish terrier. 

What might have happened there is no telling, for at that moment Bashti's eyes chanced to rest on the golden puppy for the first time since the capture of the _Arangi_. In the rush of events Bashti had forgotten the puppy.  [Q:] What had been bullied? [A:] A wild-dog  [Q:] Who bullied it? [A:] Jerry  [Q:] What breed was he? [A:] Irish terrier.  [Q:] Did the wild dog approach? [A:] Yes.  [Q:] What made it run away? [A:] a warning growl.  [Q:] How far did it run? [A:] a score of yards  [Q:] Did it try again? [A:] Yes.  [Q:] With what instinct? [A:] the instinct in him to stalk wild game  [Q:] Was he low to the ground? [A:] Yes.  [Q:] How low? [A:] so close to the ground that almost his belly touched.  [Q:] Was he loud and boisterous? [A:] No.  [Q:] What noise scared him? [A:] A noisy outburst of boys' laughter  [Q:] Did he run away again? [A:] No.  [Q:] Who had Bashti forgotten? [A:] the puppy.  [Q:] What was his name? [A:] Jerry  [Q:] Who was Bashti talking to when Jerry was forgotten? [A:] his head men  [Q:] INcluding who? [A:] Agno  [Q:] Who was Lenerengo talking with?

Timmy had the best grandmother ever. She was very nice because she would always help Timmy when he needed help with his homework. She would sit down with Timmy in the kitchen and help him with his spelling every night. Then she would go back to the living room and watch television when he worked on his math. After that she would cook Timmy a big dinner, and they would both eat it together before Timmy's mom and dad came to pick him up. When Timmy went home he would sometimes call his grandmother to say hello. Even when she was sleepy she would talk with him and tell him a bedtime story.

Harry is a boy with a learning disability. On his fourth birthday, he was given a pug called Millie. Two weeks after the dog's arrival, he was happier and calmer and said his first words, "dog" and "mummy". Just two months later, thieves stole the dog, and now the heartbroken little boy is back to where he started. He has refused to talk since losing his best friend. His mother was worried and gave him another dog, but he just "pushed it away". Mrs Hainsworth, his mother, says, "My son is very sad. He'll go over to her cage and just beat on the bars. There is no word coming out, but you just know he's screaming 'Where is Millie' inside. Millie was really his best friend. They would play together happily for hours. None of his toys has ever held his attention that long. Now he has just completely turned quiet again. "Harry suffers from a condition which affects his ability to speak and move. But the dog's being with him achieved more in days than months of speech therapy and physiotherapy had. Mrs Hainsworth says, "My son was so happy when he saw Millie. Being with Millie changed him, and within two weeks he had said his first words and was working on saying 'dad'. Just last week, his teachers and I were saying how much Millie had helped him. And now this!" Mrs Hainsworth is considering buying another pug in the hope that her son will accept it. Maureen Hennis of the charity, Pets as Therapy, says she has seen many cases of dogs helping people with speech problems. "People may talk to a dog when they wouldn't like to talk to another human," she says. "A dog doesn't care if words come out wrong." [Q:] when did the boy first talk?

Providence is the capital of and most populous city in the U.S. state of Rhode Island, founded in 1636 and one of the oldest cities in the United States. It was founded by Roger Williams, a religious exile from the Massachusetts Bay Colony. He named the area in honor of "God's merciful Providence" which he believed was responsible for revealing such a haven for him and his followers to settle. The city is situated at the mouth of the Providence River at the head of Narragansett Bay. 

Providence was one of the first cities in the country to industrialize and became noted for its textile manufacturing and subsequent machine tool, jewelry, and silverware industries. Today, the city of Providence is home to eight hospitals and seven institutions of higher learning which have shifted the city's economy into service industries, though it still retains some manufacturing activity. The city was once nicknamed the "Beehive of Industry"; it began rebranding itself as the "Creative Capital" in 2009 to emphasize its educational resources and arts community. 

The city is located in Providence County and is the third most populous city in New England, after Boston and Worcester. Providence has a city population of 179,154; it is also part of the Providence metropolitan area which extends into southern Massachusetts. The Providence metropolitan area has an estimated population of 1,604,291, which exceeds that of Rhode Island as a whole by about 60%. This can be considered, in turn, to be part of the Greater Boston commuting area, which contains 7.6 million people. [Q:] What was Providence once nicknamed?

Einstein's connection with the politics of the nuclear bomb is well known: He signed the letter to President Franklin Roosevelt that persuaded the United States to take the idea seriously, and he engaged in postwar efforts to prevent nuclear war. But these were not just the isolated actions of a scientist dragged into the world of politics. Einstein's life was, in fact, "divided between politics and equations ." 

Sickened by what he saw as the waste of human lives during the First World War, he became involved in antiwar demonstrations. His support of civil disobedience did little to endear him to his colleagues. Then, following the war, he directed his efforts toward reconciliation and improving international relations. And soon his politics were making it difficult for him to visit the United States, even to give lectures. 

Einstein's second great cause was Zionism . Although he was Jewish, Einstein rejected the idea of God. However, a growing awareness of anti-Semitism , both before and during the War, led him gradually to identify with the Jewish community, and later to become an outspoken supporter of Zionism. 

His theories came under attack. One man was accused of motivating others to murder Einstein and fined a mere six dollars. When a book was published entitled 100 Authors Against Einstein, he retorted, "If I were wrong, then one would have been enough!" When Hitler came to power, Einstein then in America declared he would not return to Germany. While Nazi attacked his house and confiscated his bank account, a Berlin newspaper displayed the headline "Good News from Einstein--He's Not Coming Back." 

Fearing that German scientists would build a nuclear bomb, Einstein proposed that the United States should develop its own. But he was publicly warning of the dangers of nuclear war and proposing international control of nuclear weaponry. Throughout his life, Einstein's efforts toward peace probably achieved little and won him few friends. His support of the Zionist cause, however, was recognized in 1952, when he was offered the presidency of Israel. He declined, saying he was too naive in politics. But perhaps his real reason was different:" Equations are more important to me, because politics is for the present, but an equation is something for eternity." [Q:] What religion was Einstein? [A:] Jewish  [Q:] Was he very religious? [A:] no  [Q:] Why did he support Zionism then? [A:] his growing awareness of anti-Semitism  [Q:] When did that start happening? [A:] before and during the War  [Q:] Were Einstein's theories widely accepted? [A:] no  [Q:] What was one man fined for conspiring to kill Einstein? [A:] six dollars  [Q:] Where did he go when Hitler rose through the ranks? [A:] America  [Q:] Was he looking forward to going back to Germany? [A:] no  [Q:] Were the German reporters upset about this? [A:] no  [Q:] Did the Nazis take his money? [A:] yes  [Q:] Why did he want the U.S. to build an atomic bomb?

Liverpool () is a city in North West England, with an estimated population of 478,580 in 2015. With its surrounding areas, it is the fifth-largest metropolitan area in the UK, with over 2.24 million people in 2011. The local authority is Liverpool City Council, the most populous local government district within the metropolitan county of Merseyside and the largest within the Liverpool City Region. 

Liverpool is located on the eastern side of the Mersey Estuary, and historically lay within the ancient hundred of West Derby in the south west of the county of Lancashire. It became a borough in 1207 and a city in 1880. In 1889, it became a county borough independent of Lancashire. Its growth as a major port was paralleled by the expansion of the city throughout the Industrial Revolution. Along with handling general cargo, freight, raw materials such as coal and cotton, the city merchants were involved in the Atlantic slave trade. In the 19th century, it was a major port of departure for Irish and English emigrants to the United States. Liverpool was home to both the Cunard and White Star Line, and was the port of registry of the ocean liner RMS "Titanic", the RMS "Lusitania", "Queen Mary" and "Olympic". [Q:] Which port was home to the Titanic? [A:] Liverpool  [Q:] Was the Queen Mary registered there as well? [A:] Yes.  [Q:] What other famous ships have called it home? [A:] Lusitania and Olympic  [Q:] What estuary lies to its west? [A:] Mersey Estuary  [Q:] Before 1889, what county was it a part of? [A:] Lancashire  [Q:] What ancient hundred does it lie in? [A:] West Derby  [Q:] Did it become a borough and a city at the same time? [A:] No.  [Q:] Which occurred first? [A:] It became a borough first.  [Q:] When was that? [A:] 1207  [Q:] When did it gain city status? [A:] 1880  [Q:] What happened that sped up the growth of the city? [A:] Its growth as a major port .  [Q:] What was going on that caused that? [A:] The Atlantic slave trade.  [Q:] Did any raw materials go through the port? [A:] Yes.  [Q:] Name one of the materials. [A:] Coal.  [Q:] What would be another example? [A:] Cotton  [Q:] If I were Irish in the 1800s and going to America, what port would I likely leave from? [A:] Liverpool  [Q:] What part of England is it in? [A:] North West  [Q:] Does the city itself have over a million inhabitants? [A:] No.  [Q:] What about the metropolitan area? [A:] Yes.  [Q:] How many metropolitan areas in the UK are larger? [A:] Four.
Weather has a strong effect on people. It influences health, intelligence and feelings. In August, it is very hot and wet in the southern part of the United States. People there easily have heart trouble and other kinds of health problems during this month. In the Northeast and the Middle West, it is hot at some times and very cold at other times. People in those states will have heart trouble after the weather changes in February or March. The weather can also influence intelligence. For example, in a 1983 study by scientists, the IQ scores of some college students were very high during storm, but after the storm, their scores were low. Storms can increase intelligence. Very hot weather, on the other hand, can decrease it. Students in many schools of the United States often do badly in exams in the hot months of the year(July and August). Weather also has a strong effect on people's feeling. Winter may be a bad time for thin people. They usually feel cold during these months. They might feel depressed during cold weather. In hot summer weather, on the other hand, fat people may feel unhappy. At about 65F, people become stronger. Low air pressure makes people feel free, but it also increases forgetful- ness. People leave more bags and umbrellas on buses and in stores on low pressure days. There is a"perfect weather"for work and health. People feel best at a tempera- ture of about 64F with 65 percent humidity . Are you feeling sick, sad, tired, forgetful, or very intelligent today? The weather may be the reason. [Q:] Does weather have an impact on human attributes? [A:] Yes  [Q:] Which ones? [A:] Health, intelligence and feelings  [Q:] What problems do people in the southern US typically have when it is hot and clammy? [A:] Heart trouble and other kinds  [Q:] Do storms impact cognitive ability? [A:] Yes  [Q:] When did the study that showed this happen? [A:] 1983  [Q:] What were the names of the scientists involved? [A:] unknown  [Q:] What group was tested? [A:] College students  [Q:] What months tend to have the highest temperatures? [A:] July and August  [Q:] Name two effects cold temperatures can have [A:] Cold and depressed  [Q:] What about two effects of low air pressure?

[A:] Very hot weather
CHAPTER VIII. STEAD IN POSSESSION. 

"At night returning, every labour sped, He sits him down, the monarch of a shed." GOLDSMITH. 

Another day made it certain that the garrison of Bristol had surrendered to the besiegers. A few shots were heard, but they were only fired in rejoicing by the Royalists, and while Steadfast was studying his barley field, already silvered over by its long beards, and wondering how soon it would be ripe, and how he should get it cut and stacked, his name was shouted out, and he saw Tom Oates and all the rest of the boys scampering down the lane. 

"Come along, Stead Kenton, come on and see, the Parliament soldiers come out and go by." 

Poor Steadfast had not much heart for watching soldiers, but it struck him that he might see or hear something of Jephthah, so he came with the other boys to the bank, where from behind a hedge they could look down at the ranks of soldiers as they marched along, five abreast, the road was not wide enough to hold more. They had been allowed to keep their weapons, so the officers had their swords, and the men carried their musquets. Most of them looked dull and dispirited, and the officers had very gloomy, displeased faces. In fact, they were very angry with their commander, Colonel Fiennes, for having surrendered so easily, and he was afterwards brought to a court-martial for having done so. 

Stead did not understand this, he thought only of looking under each steel cap or tall, slouching hat for Jephthah. Several times a youthful, slender figure raised his hopes, and disappointed him, and he began to wonder whether Jeph could have after all stayed behind in the town, or if he could have been hurt and was ill there.  [Q:] Who surrendered? [A:] the garrison of Bristol  [Q:] Why were there gunshots? [A:] they were rejoicing  [Q:] Who was? [A:] the Royalists  [Q:] What was Steadfast doing? [A:] studying his barley field  [Q:] What did he not want to watch? [A:] soldiers  [Q:] Who was he hoping to learn something about? [A:] Jephthah  [Q:] Where did they watch the soldiers? [A:] behind a hedge  [Q:] What weapons did the officers have? [A:] swords  [Q:] And the men? [A:] musquets  [Q:] Did they look happy? [A:] no  [Q:] Who were they mad at? [A:] their commander  [Q:] Wht? [A:] for surrendering  [Q:] What was the consequence for him? [A:] a court-martial
(CNN) -- A Russian bookmaking company is offering to pay 100,000 euros for Paul, the prognosticating octopus who correctly predicted Spain's win in the World Cup. 

"100,000 euros (about $129,800) was our starting price," Oleg Zhuravsky, co-owner of Liga Stavok -- "Bet League" in Russian -- told CNN. He said the offer could be increased if need be -- "We are bookmakers, after all." 

Paul currently lives at the Sea Life Center in Oberhausen, Germany. Zhuravsky said a representative of the center's public relations firm has told him the offer has been received and "they are studying it." 

However, the firm, Dederichs Reinecke and Parner, said it declined the Russian offer and that Paul will not be sold to anyone. 

"Seriously speaking, we want the octopus for a number of purposes," Zhuravsky said. "First, to see whether he can indeed effectively forecast the results of the football games. Secondly, Paul could become a good mascot, a good symbol for my bookmaking companies. And thirdly, he has an international fame like perhaps no other animal across the world does these days, and I'd love to be able to move him to Russia. 

"Both kids and adults, I'm sure, would love to see him here," he said. "We are even prepared to put him in the Moscow City Aquarium if that were the condition." 

He said Paul would be given "the best food" and officials would let him forecast the results of the Russian domestic football tournament, "which, I think, is a more difficult task than predicting the World Cup," he said.

Szczecin (; ; German and , known also by other alternative names) is the capital and largest city of the West Pomeranian Voivodeship in Poland. Located near the Baltic Sea and the German border, it is a major seaport and Poland's seventh-largest city. As of June 2011, the population was 407,811. 

Szczecin is located on the Oder, south of the Szczecin Lagoon and the Bay of Pomerania. The city is situated along the southwestern shore of Dąbie Lake, on both sides of the Oder and on several large islands between the western and eastern branches of the river. Szczecin is adjacent to the town of Police and is the urban centre of the Szczecin agglomeration, an extended metropolitan area that includes communities in the German states of Brandenburg and Mecklenburg-Vorpommern. 

The city's recorded history began in the 8th century as a Slavic Pomeranian stronghold, built at the site of the Ducal castle. In the 12th century, when Szczecin had become one of Pomerania's main urban centres, it lost its independence to Piast Poland, the Duchy of Saxony, the Holy Roman Empire and Denmark. At the same time, the House of Griffins established themselves as local rulers, the population was Christianized, and German settlers arrived from Western European states. The native Slavic population was subjected to discrimination and Germanization in the following centuries. Between 1237 and 1243, the town was rebuilt, granted extensive autonomy rights and eventually joined the Hanseatic League. [Q:] Where is Szczecin? [A:] Poland.  [Q:] When did it's history begin?

Greece is a developed country with an economy based on the service (82.8%) and industrial sectors (13.3%). The agricultural sector contributed 3.9% of national economic output in 2015. Important Greek industries include tourism and shipping. With 18 million international tourists in 2013, Greece was the 7th most visited country in the European Union and 16th in the world. The Greek Merchant Navy is the largest in the world, with Greek-owned vessels accounting for 15% of global deadweight tonnage as of 2013. The increased demand for international maritime transportation between Greece and Asia has resulted in unprecedented investment in the shipping industry. 

The country is a significant agricultural producer within the EU. Greece has the largest economy in the Balkans and is as an important regional investor. Greece was the largest foreign investor in Albania in 2013, the third in Bulgaria, in the top-three in Romania and Serbia and the most important trading partner and largest foreign investor in the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia.

CHAPTER XIV 

THE CURE 

It was noon when Harding returned to camp, ragged and exhausted, with Clarke limping after him in an even more pitiable state. The latter had suffered badly from the hurried march, but his conductor would brook no delay and the grim hints he had been given encouraged him to the utmost exertion he was capable of. Blake was alive, but when Harding bent over him he feared that help had come too late. His skin looked harsh and dry, his face had grown hollow, and his thick strong hair had turned lank and was falling out. His eyes were vacant and unrecognizing when he turned them upon Harding. 

"Here's your patient," the American said to Clarke. "We expect you to cure him, and you had better get to work at once." Then his face grew troubled as he asked Benson: "How long has he been like that?" 

"The last two days," said Benson. "I'm afraid he's very bad." 

Harding sat down with a smothered groan. Every muscle seemed to ache, he could scarcely hold himself upright, and his heart was heavy. He would miss Blake terribly; it was hard to think of going on without him, but he feared that this was inevitable. He was filled with a deep pity for the helpless man, but after a few moments his weary face grew stern. He had done all that he was able, and now Clarke, whom he believed to be a man of high medical skill, must do his part. If he were unsuccessful, it would be the worse for him.  [Q:] Which chapter? [A:] XIV  [Q:] Is it about a disease? [A:] Yes  [Q:] What time did Harding return to camp? [A:] Noon  [Q:] How long has Blake looked ill? [A:] The last two days  [Q:] What state did Clarke limp into camp in? [A:] An even more pitiable one.  [Q:] Did he have high medical skill? [A:] Yes  [Q:] Would things be worse if he was unsuccessful? [A:] Yes  [Q:] Had Harding done all he was able? [A:] Yes  [Q:] What had he smothered? [A:] Groan  [Q:] What did every one one of his muscles do? [A:] Ache  [Q:] Who had suffered badly during the hurried march? [A:] Clarke  [Q:] What level of exertion was he encouraged to give? [A:] The utmost that he was capable of.  [Q:] Who feared he had come to late? [A:] Harding  [Q:] Was Blake still alive? [A:] Yes  [Q:] What had his thick strong hair turned to? [A:] Lank  [Q:] Was Blake's hair growing fitfully and fully? [A:] No  [Q:] Was there a lot of life in Blake's eyes? [A:] No  [Q:] Was Harding African? [A:] No  [Q:] Did Harding pity Blake?

CHAPTER I. 

"Nerei repandirostrum incurvicervicum pecus." 

A dingy, swashy, splashy afternoon in October; a school-yard filled with a mob of riotous boys. A lot of us standing outside. 

Suddenly came a dull, crashing sound from the school-room. At the ominous interruption I shuddered involuntarily, and called to Smithsye:-- 

"What's up, Smithums?" 

"Guy's cleaning out the fourth form," he replied. 

At the same moment George de Coverly passed me, holding his nose, from whence the bright Norman blood streamed redly. To him the plebeian Smithsye laughingly:-- 

"Cully! how's his nibs?" 

I pushed the door of the school-room open. There are some spectacles which a man never forgets. The burning of Troy probably seemed a large-sized conflagration to the pious Aeneas, and made an impression on him which he carried away with the feeble Anchises. 

In the centre of the room, lightly brandishing the piston-rod of a steam-engine, stood Guy Heavystone alone. I say alone, for the pile of small boys on the floor in the corner could hardly be called company. 

I will try and sketch him for the reader. Guy Heavystone was then only fifteen. His broad, deep chest, his sinewy and quivering flank, his straight pastern, showed him to be a thoroughbred. Perhaps he was a trifle heavy in the fetlock, but he held his head haughtily erect. His eyes were glittering but pitiless. There was a sternness about the lower part of his face,--the old Heavystone look,--a sternness, heightened, perhaps, by the snaffle-bit which, in one of his strange freaks, he wore in his mouth to curb his occasional ferocity. His dress was well adapted to his square-set and herculean frame. A striped knit undershirt, close-fitting striped tights, and a few spangles set off his figure; a neat Glengarry cap adorned his head. On it was displayed the Heavystone crest, a cock regardant on a dunghill or, and the motto, "Devil a better!"  [Q:] What sound came from the school room? [A:] A dull, crashing sound.  [Q:] Did the author react to it? [A:] Yes.  [Q:] What did he do? [A:] Shuddered involuntarily.  [Q:] Did he ask anyone about the ruckus? [A:] Yes.  [Q:] Who? [A:] Smithums.  [Q:] How old was Guy Heavystone at the time? [A:] Fifteen.  [Q:] Did he have a small, shallow chest? [A:] No.  [Q:] How was it described? [A:] Broad, deep chest.  [Q:] What about his flank? [A:] Sinewy and quivering.  [Q:] And pastern? [A:] Straight.  [Q:] Did Smithums reply to the author? [A:] Yes.  [Q:] How did he explain the noise? [A:] Guy's cleaning out the fourth form.  [Q:] Did someone come by during this? [A:] Yes.  [Q:] Who [A:] George de Coverly.  [Q:] Was he holding something? [A:] Yes.  [Q:] What? [A:] His nose,  [Q:] Was there anything in the middle of the school room? [A:] Yes.  [Q:] Who? [A:] Guy Heavystone.  [Q:] What about in the corner? [A:] A pile of small boys.  [Q:] What was Guy wearing on his head? [A:] A neat Glengarry cap.
One day there was a six year old little girl named Megan who lived in a big house with her family. She had two dogs, a brother, a sister, and a mom and dad. Every day she woke up and went to kindergarten, played outside, and watched movies. Sometimes her family would go to a rollercoaster park. Her mom would always try to get her to ride the big rides but she was afraid and wanted to stay in Snoopyland. For two years she stayed in the little kid section of the park. Her big brother who had to babysit her was getting mad because she would not try new rides. She cried more and more until one day she got brave. She went on a little bigger musical ride that went around in circles pretty fast. She got off the ride and loved it! Her mom said to her, "Okay, let's go on the big kid rides now!" Megan was afraid again and cried and cried. For the rest of that summer she stayed in the little kid section and went on little rides. The next summer her brother brought his girlfriend home. His girlfriend's name was Sara and she was older, and loved big rides. Megan liked Sara a lot and wanted to make her like her. When Sara asked Megan if she would ride on bigger rides she said yes, and she went on her first real rollercoaster, Thunderhawk. She was frightened at first but when she stepped off the ride she loved it like she had loved the other ride last year! Now was the real test. Sara asked Megan if she wanted to go on the biggest ride in the park. She was afraid but wanted to show Sara how big she was. At the beginning of the ride Megan was afraid and was about to start crying when they went down the first big hill. Her stomach was tickled and she began laughing really loud. She stepped off the ride with a huge smile on her face and was very proud. Megan was no longer afraid of the big rides and enjoyed riding them for the rest of her life. [Q:] who was the little girl? [A:] Megan  [Q:] how old was she? [A:] six  [Q:] where did she live? [A:] in a big house  [Q:] with who? [A:] her family  [Q:] who was in it?

Chapter VIII 

The House in Onslow Crescent 



Harry, as he walked away from the house in Bolton street, hardly knew whether he was on his heels or his head. Burton had told him not to dress--"We don't give dress dinner parties, you know. It's all in the family way with us"--and Harry, therefore, went direct from Bolton street to Onslow Crescent. But, though he managed to keep the proper course down Piccadilly, he was in such confusion of mind that he hardly knew whither he was going. It seemed as though a new form of life had been opened to him, and that it had been opened in such a way as almost necessarily to engulf him. It was not only that Lady Ongar's history was so terrible, and her life so strange, but that he himself was called upon to form a part of that history, and to join himself in some sort with that life. This countess, with her wealth, her rank, her beauty, and her bright intellect, had called him to her, and told him that he was her only friend. Of course he had promised his friendship. How could he have failed to give such a promise to one whom he had loved so well? But to what must such a promise lead, or rather to what must it not have led had it not been for Florence Burton? She was young, free, and rich. She made no pretence of regret for the husband she had lost, speaking of him as though in truth she hardly regarded herself as his wife. And she was the same Julia whom he had loved, who had loved him, who had jilted him, and in regret for whom he had once resolved to lead a wretched, lonely life! Of course she must expect that he would renew it all--unless, indeed, she knew of his engagement. But if she knew it, why had she not spoken of it?  [Q:] Who lost her husband? [A:] Lady Ongar  [Q:] Who was walking somewhere? [A:] Harry,  [Q:] From where? [A:] the house  [Q:] Where? [A:] in Bolton street  [Q:] Did he have a clear head? [A:] No  [Q:] Where was he going next? [A:] Onslow Crescent  [Q:] Who was engaged? [A:] Harry  [Q:] Who had a bad past? [A:] Lady Ongar  [Q:] What was another of her titles? [A:] countess  [Q:] Did she have a lot of money? [A:] yes  [Q:] Who had he loved earlier? [A:] Julia  [Q:] Did she break up with him? [A:] Yes
When Jackie Robinson walked onto Ebbets Field in Brooklyn, New York, on April 15, 1947, he changed baseball forever. As the first African American to play in the Major League in modern times, many believe he changed the country forever. Robinson was born in 1919. He lived in a time when rules controlled what African Americans could do. He was a top athlete, playing football, basketball and baseball. But playing for a major League team was off limits to Robinson because of his race. Branch Rickey, president and manager of the Brooklyn Dodgers, signed (......) Robinson in 1947. He believed that Robinson not only had the skills, but the courage to face the challenge of becoming modern baseball's first black player. It wasn't easy. Robinson sometimes faced boos from fans. But he became a star, anyway. In 1962, he became the first African-American player chosen to enter the Baseball Hall of Fame. In 2005, he was awarded a Congressional Gold Medal, the highest award Congress can give to an American. By breaking baseball's color barrier , Robinson opened the door for many to follow his footsteps, not only in baseball, but in other areas of life as well. After he stopped playing the game, Robinson worked as a manager for a coffee company. He wrote a newspaper column . He also started a bank. [Q:] Who was said to have changed baseball forever?

Claude Monet is surely one of the most famous French artists of all. Monet was particularly interested in the effect of light and would paint the same scene in different lighting conditions or times of the day. For example, he painted around 20 versions of the Rouen Cathedral from dawn to dusk. His most famous paintings include his Water lilies series. 

The paintings of Paul Cezanne had a lot of influence in the development of 20th century art, including Cubism and Fauvism . Cezanne is one of the most famous French artists and is known as a "post-impressionist", which was similar in some ways to impressionism but also broke away from some of its limitations. Famous French paintings include his Bathers and Mont St Victoire series. 

Henri Matisse was one of the most important famous French artists of the 20th century. He was considered one of the leaders of the Fauvist movement. He had a long and varied artistic career, painting in different styles ranging from Impressionism to Abstract. In 1941, Matisse was diagnosed with cancer and was forced into a wheelchair. But this didn't stop him completing the amazing Chapel of the Rosary in Vence. 

Degas is probably one of the most fascinating of all the famous French artists. He is known as one of the founders of Impressionism, but his paintings were also influenced by classicism, romanticism, and realism. His style is definitely very unique. He was a prolific artist, producing over one thousand works. He is best known for his paintings of ballet dancers. [Q:] Degas is known as what?

(CNN) -- Evangelist Tony Alamo was arrested Thursday in Flagstaff, Arizona, on charges related to a child porn investigation, an FBI spokesman said. 

The 74-year-old founder and leader of Tony Alamo Christian Ministries was arrested without incident at 2:45 p.m. (4:45 p.m. ET) as he was departing the Little America Hotel with his wife, said Manuel Johnson, spokesman for the FBI in Phoenix, Arizona. 

The FBI, the Flagstaff Police Department and the Arizona Department of Public Safety were involved in the arrest, he said. 

Alamo was charged under a federal statute with having knowingly transported a minor across state lines with the intent to engage in sexual activity, Johnson said. 

Alamo, whose real name is Bernie Hoffman, was taken to Coconino County Jail in Flagstaff, where he is to have an initial appearance Friday in federal magistrate court, Johnson said. 

Over the weekend, about 100 federal and state agents authorities raided Alamo's 15-acre compound near Texarkana, Arkansas, and took six children into temporary custody. 

The children were interviewed as part of a two-year investigation into Tony Alamo Christian Ministries to determine whether they were physically or sexually abused, said Bill Sadler of the Arkansas State Police. 

Alamo, reached by phone Saturday in Los Angeles, California, denied any wrongdoing. 

"It's a hoax," Alamo said. "They're just trying to make our church look evil ... by saying I'm a pornographer. Saying that I rape little children. ... I love children. I don't abuse them. Never have. Never will." 

Asked why authorities were searching the property, Alamo compared himself to Christ.  [Q:] Who thinks he's Jesus? [A:] Alamo  [Q:] Does he admit to doing evil acts?

The best afternoon I ever had with my grandfather was when we went down to the river and fished. It was a hot July day, and I was bored. My grandfather was sitting in the backyard, reading. "Hey, you look like you need some fun," he said. "Want to go fishing?" I said sure, and he went to the garage. He came out with two poles, some hooks, and some fishing line. Everything was in pieces, but he showed me how to put it all together. I asked if we needed worms, and he said no. Then, we set off to the river. 

It was only about ten blocks to the river, but walking along past the library and the store, he told me about how he used to go fishing with his friend Steve. They used to catch catfish, then take them home so that their mothers could cook them for dinner. When we got to the park at the river, my grandfather went right to the bank, then turned and walked up along the side of the river until we were off in the shade under the trees right at the edge of the park. There, he taught me how to throw my line in the water. Then we sat down to wait. While we were fishing, my grandfather told me lots of stories about what he and Steve did as kids. We didn't have any worms, so we never caught any fish, but sitting there as he told me stories made it a great afternoon. [Q:] how far was it to the river? [A:] ten blocks  [Q:] what month was it? [A:] July  [Q:] were you bored? [A:] yes  [Q:] what did grandpa suggest? [A:] fishing  [Q:] did you think it was a good idea? [A:] yes  [Q:] was the gear intact?

CHAPTER XXXVIII. 

MAKING them pens was a distressid tough job, and so was the saw; and Jim allowed the inscription was going to be the toughest of all. That's the one which the prisoner has to scrabble on the wall. But he had to have it; Tom said he'd GOT to; there warn't no case of a state prisoner not scrabbling his inscription to leave behind, and his coat of arms. 

"Look at Lady Jane Grey," he says; "look at Gilford Dudley; look at old Northumberland! Why, Huck, s'pose it IS considerble trouble?--what you going to do?--how you going to get around it? Jim's GOT to do his inscription and coat of arms. They all do." 

Jim says: 

"Why, Mars Tom, I hain't got no coat o' arm; I hain't got nuffn but dish yer ole shirt, en you knows I got to keep de journal on dat." 

"Oh, you don't understand, Jim; a coat of arms is very different." 

"Well," I says, "Jim's right, anyway, when he says he ain't got no coat of arms, because he hain't." 

"I reckon I knowed that," Tom says, "but you bet he'll have one before he goes out of this--because he's going out RIGHT, and there ain't going to be no flaws in his record." 

So whilst me and Jim filed away at the pens on a brickbat apiece, Jim a-making his'n out of the brass and I making mine out of the spoon, Tom set to work to think out the coat of arms. By and by he said he'd struck so many good ones he didn't hardly know which to take, but there was one which he reckoned he'd decide on. He says:  [Q:] what job was hard? [A:] Making pens  [Q:] what was harder? [A:] The inscription  [Q:] who got to scrabble the wall [A:] The prisoner  [Q:] who has to do his coat of arms? [A:] Tom  [Q:] does he think he has one? [A:] No  [Q:] do they all have one? [A:] No  [Q:] who is right? [A:] Jim  [Q:] who filed way? [A:] Jim  [Q:] at what? [A:] At the pens  [Q:] on what? [A:] on a brickbat
CHAPTER IX 

THE BATTLE IN THE PLAIN 

The distance from the bottom of the funnel to the floor of the chamber beneath it could not have been great, for all three of the victims of Tario's wrath alighted unscathed. 

Carthoris, still clasping Thuvia tightly to his breast, came to the ground catlike, upon his feet, breaking the shock for the girl. Scarce had his feet touched the rough stone flagging of this new chamber than his sword flashed out ready for instant use. But though the room was lighted, there was no sign of enemy about. 

Carthoris looked toward Jav. The man was pasty white with fear. 

"What is to be our fate?" asked the Heliumite. "Tell me, man! Shake off your terror long enough to tell me, so I may be prepared to sell my life and that of the Princess of Ptarth as dearly as possible." 

"Komal!" whispered Jav. "We are to be devoured by Komal!" 

"Your deity?" asked Carthoris. 

The Lotharian nodded his head. Then he pointed toward a low doorway at one end of the chamber. 

"From thence will he come upon us. Lay aside your puny sword, fool. It will but enrage him the more and make our sufferings the worse." 

Carthoris smiled, gripping his long-sword the more firmly. 

Presently Jav gave a horrified moan, at the same time pointing toward the door. 

"He has come," he whimpered. 

Carthoris and Thuvia looked in the direction the Lotharian had indicated, expecting to see some strange and fearful creature in human form; but to their astonishment they saw the broad head and great-maned shoulders of a huge banth, the largest that either ever had seen.  [Q:] Who fell from one floor to the one under it? [A:] all three of the victims  [Q:] Who was mad at them? [A:] Tario  [Q:] What or who was Carthoris holding? [A:] Thuvia  [Q:] Was that a girl? [A:] yes  [Q:] How did Carthoris land? [A:] catlike  [Q:] Had it been a long drop? [A:] no  [Q:] What did Carthoris do as soon as he touched down? [A:] drew his sword  [Q:] Did he see anybody to use it on? [A:] no  [Q:] Well was there enough light to see? [A:] yes  [Q:] Did he then ask a question? [A:] yes  [Q:] Of whom? [A:] Jav  [Q:] Was Jav afraid? [A:] yes  [Q:] How afraid? [A:] he was pasty white with fear  [Q:] What did Jav think was going to happen to them? [A:] they would be devoured by Komal  [Q:] Did Jav think it was a good idea forn Carthoris to use his sword? [A:] no  [Q:] Why not? [A:] it would just enrage him more  [Q:] So did Carthoris take his advice? [A:] no  [Q:] What did he do instead? [A:] he gripped his long-sword more firmly  [Q:] What was the expression on his face? [A:] he smiled  [Q:] Did the Komal come? [A:] yes
CHAPTER XXXI. 

NELLIE ARDELL'S TROUBLES. 

On the following morning Jerry went to work at the bindery as if nothing had happened. When he went in, Dick Lanning glared at our hero and stopped as if to speak, but changed his mind and walked off without saying a word. 

During the day the young oarsman became much better acquainted with his work and began to like it. 

That night, on leaving the bindery by the side entrance, which opened on a narrow lane, our hero saw Dick Lanning and several of his friends waiting for him. 

He attempted to pass but Lenning put out his foot, and had Jerry not stopped he would have been tripped up. 

"Let me pass," said he, sharply, but instead of complying, Lenning took a stand in front of him and hit the youth on the shoulder. 

"I said I'd git square," he hissed, savagely. "If yer ain't afraid, stand up and fight." 

"I'm not afraid," replied Jerry, and pushed him up against the wall. 

Without delay a rough-and-tumble fight ensued. 

"Give it to him, Dick!" 

"Do the hayseed up!" 

"Knock him into the middle of next week!" 

These and a dozen other cries arose on the air, and the crowd kept increasing until fully a hundred spectators surrounded the pair. 

Dick Lanning had caught Jerry unfairly, but the youth soon managed to shake him off, and, hauling back, gave him a clean blow on the end of his unusually long nose, which caused the blood to spurt from that organ in a stream.  [Q:] Are the two men in this passage friends? [A:] no  [Q:] Who is the 'villain' in this scenario? [A:] Dick Lanning  [Q:] And the hero? [A:] Jerry  [Q:] Where do they work at?

[A:] a hundred  [Q:] Was Dick a fair fighter? [A:] no  [Q:] Did the hero hold his own ground though? [A:] yes
(CNN) -- He armors himself, keeps other people guessing and likes to wear a mask. 

Christian Bale is known as a hard worker who immerses himself in his characters. 

Batman? Try Christian Bale. 

Though in his case the armor and mask are metaphorical, the 34-year-old "Dark Knight" star likes to keep his personal life as shadowy as a superhero's back story. He's been known to keep a low profile -- "You will never see me at a party," he told the Times of London -- and delights in concocting stories about his life. 

"I make up [things]," he told Details magazine earlier this year. "Absolutely. I'm an actor -- I'm not a politician. I always kick myself when I talk too much about family, or personal things. I'll enjoy chatting now and then later I'll regret it." 

But with the explosive impact of "The Dark Knight" -- the film has set box office records in the 10 days since its release, becoming the fastest film to reach the $300 million mark in history -- and the forthcoming release of the fourth "Terminator," which will star Bale, he may find his privacy limited. ("The Dark Knight" is a Warner Bros. film. The studio, like CNN, is a unit of Time Warner.) 

"Can he stand the glare of the spotlight?" a rival studio executive asked Entertainment Weekly. "Being put in major roles and major films?" 

Already there are signs that Bale has made the jump from actor to movie star. Last week, news of an alleged hotel-room tussle between the actor, his mother and his sister made headlines around the world. Bale, who has denied the allegations, described the incident as "a deeply personal matter" and asked the media to "respect my privacy in the matter" at a press conference.

(CNN) -- The United States is deeply concerned about the well-being of Eman al-Obeidy, according to a State Department source, and worked closely with officials in Europe and Libya to get her safely out of the country. The same source said the U.S. is "prepared to provide whatever help and support Eman may need." 

Al-Obeidy grabbed the world's attention this spring when she accused Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi's security forces of gang-raping her. 

She is now on the way to Malta with her father, according to another high-level U.S. State Department source. She will eventually head to a processing center in Europe before leaving for a final destination. 

She has told CNN on repeated occasions that she wants to go to the United States. 

One of the State Department sources told CNN that Secretary of State Hillary Clinton "has been deeply interested in the case and has followed it throughout." 

Al-Obeidy was in Qatar awaiting resettlement as a refugee when she was deported Thursday and sent back to Libya. She was reportedly beaten before being deported. 

Najah Dawaji, a U.S.-based Libyan pro-freedom activist, said she was with three key members of Libya's Transitional National Council when they first learned that al-Obeidy was forced from Doha and arrived in Benghazi, Libya, on Thursday. She said al-Obeidy had a black eye, bruises on her legs and scratches on her arms. 

Al-Obeidy told a journalist that officials in the Transitional National Council had pressured the Qataris to expel her. But, according to Dawaji, she did not blame the rebel group for the beating itself.  [Q:] Who was reportedly beaten before being deported? [A:] Al-Obeidy  [Q:] Why was she in Qatar? [A:] Awaiting resettlement as a refugee  [Q:] On what day? [A:] Thursday  [Q:] Where was she sent back to? [A:] Libya  [Q:] Does any country care about her well-being? [A:] Yes  [Q:] Which?

Hanoi ( or ; , ) is the capital of the Socialist Republic of Vietnam and the country's second largest city by population. Its population in 2009 was estimated at 2.6 million for urban districts and 7 million for the metropolitan jurisdiction. The population in 2015 was estimated at 7.7 million people. From 1010 until 1802, it was the most important political centre of Vietnam.

From 1954 to 1976, it was the capital of North Vietnam, and it became the capital of a reunified Vietnam in 1976, after the North's victory in the Vietnam War. 

The city lies on the right bank of the Red River. Hanoi is north of Ho Chi Minh City and west of Hai Phong city. 

October 2010 officially marked 1000 years since the establishment of the city. The Hanoi Ceramic Mosaic Mural is a 4 km ceramic mosaic mural created to mark the occasion. 

Hanoi (, "inside (the) river") has had many official and unofficial names throughout history. Hanoi has been inhabited since at least 3000 BC.

Nassau, The Bahamas (CNN) -- Prince Harry, the third in Britain's line of royal succession, worshiped in a Bahamian cathedral Sunday as part of his Caribbean tour to celebrate the 60th anniversary of his grandmother's accession to the throne. 

Harry's Diamond Jubilee celebrations began Friday in the Belize capitol Belmopan, where the prince danced and drank in a street party along the newly-named HM Queen Elizabeth II Boulevard. 

The 27-year-old son of Prince Charles and Diana had a quieter day in Belize Saturday, climbing to the top of Xunantunich, a Mayan temple. 

Harry toured an open air exhibit in Nassau's Rawson Square Sunday, before boarding a speedboat for a visit to several Bahamian islands to meet with locals. 

The prince is expected to attend military exercises conducted by the Royal Bahamian Defence Force, responsible for patrolling about 1,000 islands in its 100,000 square miles of territorial waters. 

After a youth rally in the Bahamas National Stadium Monday, Harry travels to Jamaica and then on to Brazil to complete his 10-day tour.

Bruce and his other two friends, Bruno and Dick lived in the same city in England. They were free in their summer holiday. So they came to a village by a large lake. They liked fishing very much. Then the next day after they got there, they got to a boat and went fishing in the lake. They boated farther and farther. They came to an out-of-way place. They were very happy because there were a lot of fish. When it was time for them to go home, Bruce said to his friends: "We'd better make a mark here so that we will easily find the place tomorrow." "You're right." Bruno said happily ."Let me do that." "How foolish," said Bruce. "If it rains tonight, the rain water will wash the line off, and how can we find the mark tomorrow. You must cut a line with your knife." Dick came up to them and said angrily. " Neither of you is clever. How can we find the place if we have another boat tomorrow? We should not go back tonight."

A man sailed out to sea in a small boat. The sun was only rising, but this man liked spending all day fishing. A long way away from the shore, he stopped his boat. He pulled out his fishing pole and put some worms on the hook. He held it in the deep water and waited for a long time. After three hours there was still not a bite. The sun moved slowly across the sky. Morning turned into afternoon, and afternoon to evening. It was a slow day of fishing and he had to pack up. A fisherman does not give up so easy, even after many hours. It takes time to catch fish and fishing is not for people who give up quickly. The fisherman went home empty handed. He went home to his log cabin and sat by the fire. His stomach growled because there wasn't any dinner to eat tonight, but tomorrow would be a better day. [Q:] who sailed?

Little Tommy woke one morning to the sun shining and the birds singing. He had a bird that would sit outside his window that he named Martha. He really liked Martha and he fed her some bread every morning. When he was done feeding Martha he would go and feed his best buddy ever, Sammy, a big hairy dog. Tommy really loved Sammy and hung out with him all day, every day. Today he thought they would go fishing and enjoy the sunshine. Tommy found his fishing pole, some worms, and a little lunch for the day. Off Tommy and Sammy went for the day. When they got to the fishing hole Sammy ran over to a rock and started barking with his hair standing up. Tommy ran to see what Sammy had found. Under the edge of the rock was a huge green toad. Tommy laughed and laughed at Sammy and calmed him down then picked up the toad. Sammy was very interested and licked the toad. Sammy found a new friend.

(CNN) -- Russia and South Ossetia have strongly denied news reports that a motorcade carrying the presidents of Georgia and Poland came under fire, calling the claims "a provocation" meant to destabilize the region. 

Georgian President Mikheil Saakashvili, said there were "unpredictable people" in the area. 

"This is a real provocation," Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov told journalists on Monday. "It is not the first time that such things have happened: First they mastermind everything themselves and then accuse the Russian or the Ossetian side." 

Eduard Kokoity, president of the breakaway region of South Ossetia, added: "Today's event was a deliberate provocative act of the Georgian and Polish presidents targeted at regional destabilization." 

Kokoity made his comments to the Russian news agency, Interfax. 

The motorcade, carrying Georgian President Mikheil Saakashvili and Polish President Lech Kaczynski, was passing a checkpoint near Georgia's breakaway South Ossetia region -- site of intense conflict between Russian and Georgian troops in August -- when shots were fired Sunday, according to the Georgian Interior Ministry. 

The motorcade was not hit and there were no injuries, the Georgian Interior Ministry said. No other shooting was reported in the area. 

The shots were fired from Russian-controlled territory as the motorcade passed, the ministry said. 

Russia's Deputy Foreign Minister Grigory Karasin denied the gunfire came from its army positions. 

"This is one more instance of wishful thinking on the part of Georgia," he told reporters. 

After the incident, Saakashvili told reporters he would not have taken his Polish counterpart into danger intentionally and that the incident showed "you are dealing with unpredictable people" in the disputed area.

I am going to get a hamster in a few weeks, or maybe a month! I have been waiting for a hamster for years, so I don't want to wait another day! She's going to have a big home with lots of paper towel rolls to eat, or even sleep in. My little hamster is going to bite me in the beginning, as hamsters are nervous, but we're going to end up being best friends. She's going to sit on my shoulder as I do the dishes or do my homework. When I'm reading my favorite book, sleeping, or when I'm showering, my hamster needs to go back to her home. I think that she is going to pee without warning and at the worst times, I am going to scratch her little belly and love her all the more when she pushes carrots into her mouth. I am sure that my little hamster is going to get into a lot more trouble, too. Maybe she'll be scared of thunder and try to run away. Or maybe she'll be so curious about going outside to the street that she might get hurt. I do not care about the amount of trouble that my little hamster gets into I'll always make sure she has water to drink, food to eat, and love from my heart. [Q:] What animal is the subject?

"What is success"? Mr. Black asked his 6th grade business class. It was his opening conversation for the first class of the term. "Success is riding in a sweet car, watching an 80-inch( TV, and living in a place with at least twelve rooms." One student answered, earning laughs from all the students. Mr. Black smiled, but shook his head. "Tom, that is excess . That is not success." "How about being able to provide for your family?" A blonde girl named Sandy in the front suggested as an answer. "Now we're getting closer," Mr. Black smiled, "but try thinking about what you need and what you want." "Getting everything you want." Tom shouted out an answer again, trying for more laughs. Mr. Black sighed ." I believe we've already talked about excess versus(...) success." "Getting everything you need, but some of what you want?" James, sitting in the back wondered aloud. "Quite right!" Mr. Black clapped. "Success is getting everything you need and some of what you want. The more you get that you want, the more successful you are. You do reach a point where you are living in excess, though." "What does this have to do with business?" Tom asked. It seemed if it wasn't funny, he wasn't happy. "Well, Tom, think of it this way: the point of business is to make a living to support your family. Once you have properly seen to their needs, you can then seen to getting the extras that you want." "What if I don't have a family?" he continued to be difficult. "Then you have to provide for yourself, a family of one." "He has goldfish to think about!" Peter, Tom's friend, shouted out. "Then he needs to provide for a family of one with a fishbowl." Mr. Black corrected himself. Tom nodded, satisfied with that answer. "So in the next nine weeks, we're going to study basic business situations, like having a checking account and understanding credit cards ." Tom rubbed his hands together excitedly. "When do we get to start spending?" "You already are, Tom. You're spending time with us!" Mr. Black laughed. "Now, let's see what you guys know about credit cards..." [Q:] mr black asked what ?

(CNN) -- Hashim Amla became the first South African to score a triple century in Test cricket as his side dominated No.1 ranked England at The Oval Sunday. 

Amla was 311 not out as South Africa declared on a massive 637 for two wickets before taking four cheap England wickets by the close of the fourth day. 

It left England needing 150 runs to avoid a humiliating innings defeat with only six wickets left. 

Amla shared a record 377 unbroken stand for the third wicket with Jacques Kallis, who was 182 not out when captain Graeme Smith called his men in. 

The previous Test best for South Africa had come from current teammate AB de Villiers, who hit 278 not out against Pakistan in Abu Dhabi in 2010-11. 

"I am happy, surprised and really excited that I managed to do something that has never been done before by a South African, but the biggest pleasure is that the team is in a dominant position to win this Test match," Amla told gathered reports. 

"I didn't dream about getting 300," he added. "I've always been a person who never sets goals. In many ways that helps you because you can keep going without being limited." 

Amla batted for just over 13 hours and hit 35 fours, including a boundary off Tim Bresnan when on 299, lofting it over the infield before taking a prolonged standing ovation from the crowd. 

They had seen England's much-vaunted bowling attack blunted on a docile pitch with Kallis reaching his 43rd Test ton in tandem.  [Q:] Who scored triple century for his country?

Adam and his mom, Deborah, ran across the front lawn of their house. The grass was very tall, the lawn had not been mowed. After removing the groceries from the car, Adam had wanted to play in the yard. Deborah did not. She was sad that her new boss at work, Pierre, did not seem to like her. She ran along with Adam, but he could tell that Deborah was upset. Adam asked his mom what was bothering her. Deborah explained that she felt like her new boss was not nice to her. Adam sat down in the grass and asked Deborah to sit down next to him. He told her that he had a bully in his class named Mike. Adam said that all he had to do was ignore the bully and he would feel better. Then Adam asked why his mom could not ignore her new boss. Deborah explained to Adam that her new boss could fire her.

Fifty-two countries have participated in the Eurovision Song Contest since it started in 1956. Of these, twenty-seven have won the contest. The contest, organised by the European Broadcasting Union (EBU), is held annually between members of the Union. Broadcasters from different countries submit songs to the event, and cast votes to determine the most popular in the competition. 

Participation in the contest is primarily open to all active member broadcasters of the EBU. To be an active member, broadcasters must be a member of the European Broadcasting Union, or be in a Council of Europe member country. Eligibility to participate is not determined by geographic inclusion within the continent of Europe, despite the "Euro" in "Eurovision" — nor does it have a direct connection with the European Union. Several countries geographically outside the boundaries of Europe have competed: Israel, Cyprus and Armenia, in Western Asia, since 1973, 1981 and 2006 respectively; Morocco, in North Africa, in the 1980 competition alone; and Australia making a debut in the 2015 contest. In addition, several transcontinental countries with only part of their territory in Europe have competed: Turkey, since 1975; Russia, since 1994; Georgia, since 2007; and Azerbaijan, which made its first appearance in the 2008 edition. Two of the countries that have previously sought to enter the competition, Lebanon and Tunisia, in Western Asia and North Africa respectively, are also outside of Europe. The Gulf state of Qatar, in Western Asia, announced in 2009 its interest in joining the contest in time for the 2011 edition. However, this did not materialise, and there are no known plans for a future Qatari entry the Eurovision Song Contest. Australia, where the contest has been broadcast since the 1970s, debuted as a participant in the 2015 edition, with entries in 2016 and 2017. [Q:] Who can take part in the contest?

Sally had a very exciting summer vacation. She went to summer camp for the first time. She made friends with a girl named Tina. They shared a bunk bed in their cabin. Sally's favorite activity was walking in the woods because she enjoyed nature. Tina liked arts and crafts. Together, they made some art using leaves they found in the woods. Even after she fell in the water, Sally still enjoyed canoeing. She was sad when the camp was over, but promised to keep in touch with her new friend. 

Sally went to the beach with her family in the summer as well. She loves the beach. Sally collected shells and mailed some to her friend, Tina, so she could make some arts and crafts with them.

Futsal, (literally "mini-football", "futebol de salão" i.e. "big room soccer"), is a variant of association football played on a hard court, smaller than a football pitch, and mainly indoors. It can be considered a version of five-a-side football. 

Futsal is played between two teams of five players each, one of whom is the goalkeeper. Unlimited substitutions are permitted. Unlike some other forms of indoor football, the game is played on a hard court surface delimited by lines; walls or boards are not used. Futsal is also played with a smaller ball. The surface, ball, and rules create an emphasis on improvisation, creativity, and technique as well as ball control and passing in small spaces. 

"Futsal" comes from Spanish "fútbol sala or fútbol de salón" and from Portuguese "futebol de salão". The term is commonly translated as "indoor football" but a more literal translation is "hall/lounge football". During the sport's second world championships held in Madrid in 1985, the Spanish name "fútbol sala" was used. Since then, all other names have been officially and internationally changed to "futsal". The naming was due to a dispute between FIFUSA (the predecessor to the AMF) and FIFA over the name of "fútbol", FIFUSA has registered the word "fut-sal" in 1985 (Madrid, Spain). Since then FIFA has also started using the term futsal. The name has been translated into Italian as "calcio a 5" or "football sala", and French as "football de salle". [Q:] What languages does the word futsal come from? [A:] Spanish and Portuguese  [Q:] What is the translation in English? [A:] big room soccer  [Q:] What ground is it played on?

CHAPTER XXX 

THE RESCUE--CONCLUSION 

The Rovers and the others on the steam tug could scarcely wait for the old man in the dilapidated rowboat to come up alongside. 

"You have a message for us?" said Dick. "Hand it over, quick." 

"The message says as how you-uns will pay me twenty-five dollars fer delivering of it in twenty-four hours," said the old man, cautiously. 

"Who is it from?" 

"It is signed Dora Stanhope and Nellie Laning." 

"Give it to me--I'll pay you the money," cried Tom. 

"All right, reckon as how I kin trust you-uns," said the old man. 

It was Jake Shaggam, who had received the message the evening before. He had read it with interest and started out at daylight to find out something about the Rovers and where they might be located. Good fortune had thrown him directly in our young friends' way. 

"This is really a message from the girls!" cried Tom, reading it hastily. "It is in Nellie Laning's handwriting." 

"And Dora Stanhope has signed her name too," added Dick. "I know her signature well." 

"Of course you do," put in Fred, dryly, but nobody paid attention to the sally. 

"They are on the houseboat, and the craft is hidden up Shaggam Creek," put in Sam. He turned to the captain of the tug. "Where is Shaggam Creek?" 

"This ere is Shaggam Creek, an' I'm Jake Shaggam," answered the hermit. "But you-uns said you'd pay me thet twenty-five dollars." 

"I will," said Tom, and brought out the amount at once.  [Q:] What was someone delivering? [A:] a message  [Q:] Who delivered it? [A:] Jake Shaggam  [Q:] What compensation did he expect?

London, England (CNN) -- "Some people believe football is a matter of life and death... I assure you it is much, much more important than that." 

As Bill Shankly, the legendary former manager of English club Liverpool, pointed out shortly before he passed away in 1981, the significance of the beautiful game can never be underestimated -- and that doesn't just apply to fans of the sport, either. 

Soccer can affect lives on a national and international scale, inspiring revolutions and causing wars as well as having the capability to create peace and lift entire nations. 

The "Football War" between Honduras and El Salvador in 1969 is perhaps the most famous example of the sport's wider implications. The two Central American nations famously came to blows following their qualification match for the 1970 World Cup. 

Pedro Pinto's World Cup predictions 

But this wasn't the first time, and definitely won't be the last, that the worlds of football and politics collide with remarkable results. 

1. Mussolini manipulates the "man in black," 1934 

"Il Duce" was determined to use this World Cup on home soil to showcase his fascist Italy. Mussolini had his own trophy created for the event -- the Coppa Del Duce -- which was six times the size of the Jules Rimet, and to this day allegations remain the tournament was fixed so that only Italy would collect it. 

According to the BBC's "World Cup Stories" book by Chris Hunt, there were suggestions that the Italian dictator himself picked the referees. In the semifinal against Austria, Mussolini's Azzurri team won 2-1, but after the game their opponents complained the game was fixed.  [Q:] What sport do people believe is very important? [A:] Football.  [Q:] Who thinks so? [A:] Some people.  [Q:] Who died in 1981? [A:] Bill Shankly.  [Q:] Who was he? [A:] Former manager of English club Liverpool,  [Q:] Was he well known? [A:] Legendary.  [Q:] What happened in 1969? [A:] The "Football War".  [Q:] Who was a part of it? [A:] Honduras and El Salvador  [Q:] Are those European nations? [A:] No.  [Q:] What sparked the conflict? [A:] They came to blows after qualification.  [Q:] When was that? [A:] 1970.  [Q:] Was this the only time this happened? [A:] no.  [Q:] Will it be the last? [A:] It definitely won't be the last  [Q:] What other year did it happen? [A:] 1934  [Q:] Who was manipulated? [A:] The "man in black,"  [Q:] By whom? [A:] Mussolini.  [Q:] What did he have made? [A:] His own trophy  [Q:] What was it called? [A:] the Coppa Del Duce  [Q:] How big was it? [A:] Six times the size of the Jules Rimet  [Q:] Was the game rigged? [A:] Allegations remain that it was.

Gujarati is an Indo-Aryan language native to the Indian state of Gujarat. It is part of the greater Indo-European language family. Gujarati is descended from Old Gujarati ("circa" 1100–1500 AD). In India, it is the official language in the state of Gujarat, as well as an official language in the union territories of Daman and Diu and Dadra and Nagar Haveli. Gujarati is the language of the Gujjars, who had ruled Rajputana and Punjab. 

According to the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), 4.5% of the Indian population (1.21 billion according to the 2011 census) speaks Gujarati, which amounts to 46 million speakers in India. There are about 50 million speakers of Gujarati worldwide, making it the 26th-most-spoken native language in the world. Gujarati was the first language of Mahatma Gandhi and Muhammad Ali Jinnah. 

Gujarati (also sometimes spelled "Gujerati", "Gujarathi", "Guzratee", "Guujaratee", "Gujarati", "Gujrathi", and "Gujerathi") is a modern IA (Indo-Aryan) language evolved from Sanskrit. The traditional practice is to differentiate the IA languages on the basis of three historical stages: Another view postulates successive family tree splits, in which Gujarati is assumed to have separated from other IA languages in four stages: 

The principal changes from Sanskrit are the following:

(CNN)The family of a Jordanian fighter pilot mercilessly killed by ISIS is calling for total revenge. 

Lt. Moath al-Kasasbeh, 27, was burned alive while confined in a cage. 

In response, Jordan executed two prisoners -- Sajida al-Rishawi, a would-be suicide bomber whose release ISIS had previously demanded as part of a prisoner exchange, and Ziad Karbouli, a former top aide to the deceased leader of al Qaeda in Iraq, Abu Musab al-Zarqawi. 

The pilot's father is demanding his country do more. 

"These were criminals and there is no comparison between them and Moath. His blood is more valued than Sajida al-Rishawi and Ziad Karbouli," said al-Kasasbeh's father, Safi. "I demand that revenge should be bigger than executing prisoners." 

His son's horrific death was recorded and the video was posted online Tuesday. 

CNN is not showing the images, which drew global condemnation and prompted protests and vows of retaliation in Jordan. 

King Abdullah has promised a strong response, saying that ISIS isn't just fighting his nation, but warring against "noble Islam" itself. 

The country now wants to step up airstrikes against the terrorist organization, according to a source with direct knowledge of the situation. 

But the pilot's uncle, Yassin Al Rawashdeh, told CNN that he also wants to see ground troops involved in the U.S.-led coalition against ISIS in Iraq and Syria. 

Said the pilot's father: "I demand that this criminal organization (ISIS) ... should be annihilated." 

What comes next? 

Demonstrators took to the streets in Amman and the pilot's hometown immediately after the video was made public.  [Q:] Where was the pilot from? [A:] jordan.  [Q:] Who was he killed by? [A:] ISIS i  [Q:] how old was the lieutenant? [A:] 27  [Q:] What was he trapped in when burnt alive? [A:] A cage.  [Q:] How many prisoners did Jordan kill?

(CNN) -- Lionel Messi is not for sale. 

That was the defiant message from Barcelona's new president, who is adamant that the club's all-time leading goalscorer is going nowhere amid reports French club Paris St Germain want to sign the Argentine. 

Josep Maria Bartomeu will sit down with the four-time World Player of the Year to thrash out a new contract which will see him remain as most highly-paid at the Camp Nou. 

"We want to sit down, without any rush, with Leo's father -- it's not something that's happening tomorrow, we have plenty of time, but we will do what we have to to ensure he's the best paid player," said Josep Maria Bartomeu, who assumed control at Barca after Sandro Rosell's resignation last week. 

Messi arrived at Barca in 2000 , graduating through the club's youth system before going on to establish himself as the best player on the planet. 

Since making his first team debut in 2004, Messi has helped the team win six Spanish league titles, two Spanish Cups and three European Champions League crowns. 

Blog: Is Ronaldo really the best? 

The club's determination to keep hold of Messi will be sweet relief to Barca fans after a turbulent few weeks. 

Former president Rosell stepped down after a Spanish judge's decision to investigate the deal which saw Neymar move to Catalonia from Brazilian team Santos last June. 

The club initially announced the deal was worth $78 million, but the breakdown of the agreement was never revealed. 

A Barcelona member launched a case against Rosell for not disclosing the full details and the club was asked by Spanish authorities to hand over documentation, as well as accounts for the past three years.

The North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO ; ; '), also called the North Atlantic Alliance, is an intergovernmental military alliance between several North American and European states based on the North Atlantic Treaty that was signed on 4 April 1949. 

NATO constitutes a system of collective defence whereby its member states agree to mutual defence in response to an attack by any external party. Three NATO members (the United States, France and the United Kingdom) are permanent members of the United Nations Security Council with the power to veto and are officially nuclear-weapon states. NATO Headquarters are located in Haren, Brussels, Belgium, while the headquarters of Allied Command Operations is near Mons, Belgium. 

NATO is an alliance that consists of 29 independent member countries across North America and Europe. An additional 21 countries participate in NATO's Partnership for Peace program, with 15 other countries involved in institutionalized dialogue programs. The combined military spending of all NATO members constitutes over 70% of the global total. Members' defense spending is supposed to amount to at least 2% of GDP. 

NATO was little more than a political association until the Korean War galvanized the organization's member states, and an integrated military structure was built up under the direction of two US Supreme Commanders. The course of the Cold War led to a rivalry with nations of the Warsaw Pact, that formed in 1955. Doubts over the strength of the relationship between the European states and the United States ebbed and flowed, along with doubts over the credibility of the NATO defense against a prospective Soviet invasion—doubts that led to the development of the independent French nuclear deterrent and the withdrawal of France from NATO's military structure in 1966 for 30 years. After the fall of the Berlin Wall in Germany in 1989, the organization became involved in the breakup of Yugoslavia, and conducted its first military interventions in Bosnia from 1992 to 1995 and later Yugoslavia in 1999. Politically, the organization sought better relations with former Warsaw Pact countries, several of which joined the alliance in 1999 and 2004.

CHAPTER XXXII 

LITTLE NELL--CONCLUSION 

Jean Bevoir was now thoroughly cowed, and once having exposed himself he did all in his power to curry favor with those he had so deeply wronged, in the hope that they would relent in their treatment of him and perhaps grant him his ultimate liberty. But neither Henry nor the others would make him any promises, for nobody had any intention of letting him go free. 

"He deserves to become a prisoner," said Dave. "And he ought to be put in solitary confinement and on bread and water." 

"Right ye are, lad," said Barringford. "He's wuss nor a snake in the grass. I don't wonder Henry felt like pepperin' him on the spot." 

It was well along in the middle of the afternoon and the rangers who had been out on the hunt were thoroughly tired, yet it was arranged that those who had remained in camp should move to the cave near the falls without delay, after getting minute directions from Jean Bevoir, so that there should be no chance of making a mistake in the route. A strict guard was ordered over the trader and he was given to understand that if anything went wrong with those who set out on the search for little Nell and the others the blame would fall upon him. 

It must be said that the hearts of both Henry and Dave beat rapidly as they pushed along the trail leading towards the falls. Henry, as we know, loved his little sister dearly, and Dave's affection for his little cousin was scarcely less strong. Throughout the whole campaign there had not been a day when they had not thought of her and of what she must be suffering.  [Q:] What did Dave think Jean deserved? [A:] To become a prisoner  [Q:] Where did he think they should put him? [A:] In solitary confinement  [Q:] Would he be allowed to eat? [A:] Bread and water  [Q:] Who agreed with him?

It is easy to say "to be Best Friends Forever (BFF)". However, a true BFF helps out when the other is in trouble, not just once or twice, but for a lifetime. Milo is six years old. He has become Eddie's BFF. They are special because they are not humans, but dogs. Their owner, Angie Baker, brought them up. They spent many years playing together. However, last year, Eddie suddenly started walking into dustbins and walls. Soon he lost his eyesight. When Milo felt something was wrong, he decided to act as Eddie's "guide" dog. He leads Eddie through the house. When they go for walks, he holds Eddie's leash . Once, Milo had to spend a few nights at the hospital himself. Poor Eddie often bumped into walls and furniture. Ever worse, he got lost during walks. Angie realized how much Eddie depended on his friend. Luckily, Milo is now fine and back at his BFF's side, guiding him through life again.

Wang Bing is a 12-year-old boy. He likes sports very much and does well in sports. One afternoon, he comes out of the classroom and sees his father waiting for him at the school gate. He is very glad and he runs to his father. "Dad, please don't wait for me after school next time. I can go home by myself . I have grown up." says Wang Bing. "Let's go," says the father, "I'll cook supper and you can do your homework at home: Mum is still at work."On their way home, Wang Bing sees some boys skating in a park. "Can I go and learn skating. Dad?" asks Wang Bing. "I'm sorry, my boy. You must go home and do your homework," answers his father, "but I can buy you an ice-cream." Then his father buys an ice-cream for him.

CHAPTER XXIV: A Merry Home-Going 

"The Laughing Brook is merry And so am I," cried Jerry. Grandfather Frog said he was too. And Spotty was, the others knew. 

The trees stood with wet feet where just a little while before had been the strange pond in the Green Forest, the pond made by the dam of Paddy the Beaver. In the dam was a great hole made by Paddy himself. 

Through the Green Forest rang the laughter of the Laughing Brook, for once more the water ran deep between its banks. And in the hearts of Grandfather Frog and Jerry Muskrat and Spotty the Turtle was laughter also, for now the Smiling Pool would smile once more, and they could go home in peace and happiness. And there was one more who laughed. Who was it? Why, Paddy the Beaver to be sure, and his was the best laugh of all, for it was because he had brought happiness to others. 

"You beat me up here to the dam, but you won't beat me back to the Smiling Pool," cried Jerry Muskrat to Spotty the Turtle. 

Spotty laughed good-naturedly. "You'd better not stop to eat or play or sleep on the way then," said he, "for I shall keep right on going all the time. I've found that is the only way to get anywhere." 

"Let us all go down together" said Grandfather Frog. "We can help each other over the bad places." 

Jerry Muskrat laughed until he had to hold his sides at the very thought of Grandfather Frog or Spotty the Turtle being able to help him, but he is very good-natured, and so he agreed that they should all go down together. Paddy the Beaver said that he would go, too, so off the four started, Jerry Muskrat and Paddy the Beaver swimming side by side, and behind them Grandfather Frog and Spotty the Turtle.

(CNN) -- President Barack Obama has nominated his top counterterrorism adviser, John Brennan, to be the next director of the CIA. 

If there is an emerging Obama doctrine to deal with the threat from al Qaeda and its allies, it is clearly a rejection of the use of conventional military forces and a growing reliance instead on the use of drones and U.S. Special Operations Forces -- and Brennan has been central to Obama's policy. 

In an April 30 speech at the Woodrow Wilson Center in Washington, Brennan laid out the rationale for the drone policy in more detail than any administration official had done publicly hitherto. He asserted that the drone strikes are legal both under the Authorization for Use of Military Force passed by Congress after the September 11 attacks and because, "There is nothing in international law that bans the use of remotely piloted aircraft for this purpose or that prohibits us from using lethal force against our enemies outside of an active battlefield, at least when the country involved consents or is unable or unwilling to take action against the threat." 

This does not appear to be the view of Ben Emmerson, U.N. special rapporteur on counterterrorism and human rights, who announced plans at Harvard Law School in October to launch an investigation into U.S. drone attacks and the extent to which they cause civilian casualties. 

Politics: Compared to Hagel, reaction to Brennan nomination muted 

One of Brennan's most significant legacies in the four years he has been the president's principal adviser on terrorism is the U.S. drone campaign against al Qaeda and its allies in countries such as Pakistan and Yemen -- one that has shifted focus significantly in the past year or so.  [Q:] Who did Obama nominate? [A:] John Brennan.  [Q:] To be what? [A:] Next director of the CIA.  [Q:] Was he Obama's adviser before that? [A:] Yes.  [Q:] What kind? [A:] His top counterterrorism adviser,  [Q:] On what day did Brennan give his speech? [A:] April 30  [Q:] At what facility? [A:] The Woodrow Wilson Center.  [Q:] In what location? [A:] Washington.  [Q:] What did Brennan talk about in great detail? [A:] The drone policy.  [Q:] Did he say it was legal or illegal? [A:] Legal.  [Q:] What was passed by Congress? [A:] Authorization for Use of Military Force.  [Q:] After what event was it passed? [A:] The September 11 attacks.  [Q:] Does Ben Emmerson have the same opinion as Brennan? [A:] No.  [Q:] What is Emmerson's job title? [A:] U.N. special rapporteur on counterterrorism and human rights.  [Q:] Where did he announce his plans? [A:] Harvard Law School.  [Q:] In what month? [A:] October.  [Q:] Was he launching an investigation? [A:] Yes.  [Q:] Into what? [A:] U.S. drone attacks.  [Q:] And? [A:] And the extent to which they cause civilian casualties.
Michelle and Anthony were having lunch in the park with their mother. She had made them a picnic lunch, including sandwiches, fruit and potato chips. As they looked around the park, they watched the other families play and eat lunch. There was one family that had 3 dogs with them. The dogs were chasing each other and playing Frisbee with their people. Another family had a big blanket set out and were watching their baby learn to crawl on his tummy. Anthony asked his sister if she wanted the rest of his potato chips. Michelle said no, that she was full. They got up and went over to the family with the dogs. The white dog jumped on Michelle and licked her face, knocking her down. The brown dog wagged his tail and sniffed Anthony. The black dog was shy and went to sit with his family. After they said goodbye to the dogs, Michelle and Anthony saw their friends Mike and Molly across the park. They asked their mom if they could go play with them and she said yes. They ran to their friends and told them about the dogs they had met. Mike and Molly's mom gave Michelle and Anthony some strawberry ice cream for dessert. They thanked her, and when they finished, they went back to their mom, ready to go home and take a nap. [Q:] Where were Michelle and Anthony? [A:] at the park  [Q:] What were they doing there?

CHAPTER TWENTY TWO. 

MAXIMUS--DEER SPEARING--A SURPRISINGLY BAD SHOT--CHARACTER OF THE NATIVES. 

"Hallo! what have we here?" exclaimed Stanley, starting from his seat in amazement, as the giant entered the hall of Fort Chimo--his left hand grasping a blood-stained wolf by the throat, and Edith resting in his right arm. 

At first the startled father imagined his child must have been wounded, if not killed, by the savage animal; but his mind was immediately relieved on this point by Edith herself, who was no sooner laid on her bed than she recovered sufficiently to narrate the circumstances attending her fall. 

"Well, Maximus," said Stanley, returning to the hall and applying to the bulky savage the term that seemed most appropriate to him, "shake hands with me, my good fellow. You've saved Chimo's life, it seems; and that's a good turn I'll not forget. But a--. I see you don't understand a word I say. Hallo! Moses, Moses! you deaf rascal, come here!" he shouted, as that worthy passed the window. 

"Yis, mossue," said Moses, entering the hall. "Oh, me! what a walrus am dis! Me do b'lieve him most high as a tree an' more broader nor iveryt'ing!" 

"Hold thy tongue, Moses, and ask the fellow where he came from; but tell him first that I'm obliged to him for saving Chimo from that villainous wolf." 

While Moses interpreted, Arnalooa and Okatook, being privileged members of the tribe, crossed over to Edith's room. 

"Well, what says he?" inquired Stanley, at the end of a long address which the giant had delivered to Moses.  [Q:] What came into Fort Chimo? [A:] the giant  [Q:] What was he holding? [A:] wolf  [Q:] WAs he alone? [A:] no  [Q:] Who was with him? [A:] Edith  [Q:] Where did he put her? [A:] his right arm  [Q:] Did Stanley want to shake hands? [A:] yes  [Q:] Did he think he had saved someone's life?' [A:] yes  [Q:] Whose? [A:] Chimo  [Q:] Where was Moses entering? [A:] hall  [Q:] who were members of the tribe? [A:] Arnalooa
One of Britain's bravest women told yesterday how she helped to catch suspected police killer David Bieber--and was thanked with flowers by the police. It was also said that she could _ a share of up to $30,000 reward money. 

Vicki Brown, 30, played a very important role in ending the nationwide manhunt. Vicki, who has worked at the Royal Hotel for four years, told of her terrible experience when she had to steal into Bieber's bedroom and to watch him secretly. Then she waited alone for three hours while armed police prepared to storm the building. 

She said, "I was very nervous. But when I opened the hotel door and saw 20 armed policemen lined up in the car park, I was so glad they were there." 

The alarm had been raised because Vicki became suspicious of the guest who checked in at 3 p.m. the day before New Year's Eve with little luggage and wearing sunglasses and a hat pulled down over his face. She said, "He didn't seem to want to talk too much or make any eye contact." Vicki, the only employee on duty, called her bosses Margaret, 64, and her husband Stall McKale, 65, who phoned the police at 11 p.m. 

Officers from Northumbria Police called Vicki at the hotel in Dunston, Gateshead, at about 11:30 p.m. to make sure that this was the wanted man. Then they kept in touch by phoning Vicki every 15 minutes. 

"It was about ten past two in the morning when the phone went again and a policeman said 'Would you go and make yourself known to the armed officers outside?' My heart missed a beat." 

Vicki quietly showed eight armed officers through passages and staircases to the top floor room and handed over the key. 

"I realized that my bedroom window overlooks that pair of the hotel, so I went to watch. I could not see into the man's room, but I could see the passage . The police kept shouting at the man to come out with his hands showing. Then suddenly he must have come out because they shouted for him to lie down while he was handcuffed ."

Before Nicholas Clapp got there, he had half hoped that he might run into some of Ubar's ruins sticking out of the sand. But finding the city wasn't that easy. During the summer, he and his 40 helpers dug at 35 different spots. The only things they found were ground spiders, giant ticks, and deadly snakes. 

Just before Thanksgiving says Clapp, _ 

But then Clapp's team looked at the high-tech maps again and saw something surprising. Many of the caravan routes on the high-tech maps came together on the same spot marked "Omani Marketplace" on Ptolomy's map. Two maps, made almost 2000 years apart, pointed the team toward the same area! 

In December 1991, Clapp arrived at the spot where, according to the maps, the caravans met. Clapp had a handheld instrument that could detect objects below the ground. It showed ruins under the sand! He and his team started digging. And then they found it! A tower buried in the sand. They slowly unearthed a giant, eight-sided fortress . It had nine towers and many rooms. People had lived in this fortress 2000 years ago. Outside its walls, they had found buried remains of nearly 40 campsites. They seemed to be camping areas for traders . 

More digging found shards, or pieces of pottery from ancient Rome, Greece, China, Egypt, and Syria. Diggers and scientists agree that people were here for about 5000 years. Clapp and his team were excited as they continued to discover more pieces of the past that seemed to prove that it was the lost city of Ubar. 

"We started with this hopeless myth ," says Clapp, "and then finally found the truth behind the myth." But is this unearthed site really the once-great Ubar? Experts aren't totally persuaded. 

Donald Whitcomb is an archeologist at the University of Chicago. He doubts that Clapp really discovered Ubar. "There's probably some truth to this myth," he says. "But Ubar is described as a place with walls all made of gold, and the rubies and emeralds ." No gold or precious stones have been found by Clapp. 

"I'm not sure whether they discovered Ubar because I'm not sure if Ubar really existed," Whitcomb says. [Q:] Where did the caravan routes merge? [A:] "Omani Marketplace"  [Q:] Marked on whose map? [A:] Ptolomy's  [Q:] How far apart were the 2 maps created? [A:] almost 2000 years  [Q:] Did they end up pointing to the same area?

Los Angeles, California (CNN) -- Farrah Fawcett's son, Redmond O'Neal, visited his mother's grave for the first time Friday, the anniversary of the actress's death. 

"It was very nice, very beautifully set up," he said, sitting on a couch between his father, Ryan O'Neal, and sister, Tatum O'Neal. "I'm just happy that I'm able to be there for her and let her know I'm doing all right." 

Redmond O'Neal was on a day pass away from the Pasadena, California, sober living facility where he is undergoing court-ordered drug rehab. 

The three O'Neals were near tears as they spoke exclusively to CNN during a private gathering of friends and family at the Beverly Hills, California, headquarters of the Farrah Fawcett Foundation. 

"Redmond is extremely well," Ryan O'Neal said. "He is recovering from a terrible disease. He seems to have cured himself. We are thrilled about that. And that's why he's here, because they let him." 

"To show my face and let everybody know that I'm doing good, you know," Redmond O'Neal said. "You can't hide forever." 

"And how handsome he is and how much he looks like Farrah," Tatum O'Neal said. "And how proud she would be and how lucky I am that I can at least be here, because he's so awesome. Oh, I'm going to cry." 

The foundation has a mission of funding research and clinical trials into alternative treatments for anal cancer -- which killed Fawcett -- and pediatric cancers. 

"We're trying to show that she hasn't left, that her name is still alive and that maybe there will be something good that comes from this," said Ryan O'Neal, her longtime companion.

In modern molecular biology and genetics, the genome is the genetic material of an organism. It consists of DNA (or RNA in RNA viruses). The genome includes both the genes and the non-coding sequences of the DNA/RNA. 

The term was created in 1920 by Hans Winkler, professor of botany at the University of Hamburg, Germany. The Oxford Dictionary suggests the name to be a blend of the words gene and chromosome. However, see omics for a more thorough discussion. A few related -ome words already existed—such as biome, rhizome, forming a vocabulary into which genome fits systematically. 

Some organisms have multiple copies of chromosomes: diploid, triploid, tetraploid and so on. In classical genetics, in a sexually reproducing organism (typically eukarya) the gamete has half the number of chromosomes of the somatic cell and the genome is a full set of chromosomes in a diploid cell. The halving of the genetic material in gametes is accomplished by the segregation of homologous chromosomes during meiosis. In haploid organisms, including cells of bacteria, archaea, and in organelles including mitochondria and chloroplasts, or viruses, that similarly contain genes, the single or set of circular or linear chains of DNA (or RNA for some viruses), likewise constitute the genome. The term genome can be applied specifically to mean what is stored on a complete set of nuclear DNA (i.e., the "nuclear genome") but can also be applied to what is stored within organelles that contain their own DNA, as with the "mitochondrial genome" or the "chloroplast genome". Additionally, the genome can comprise non-chromosomal genetic elements such as viruses, plasmids, and transposable elements. [Q:] Who created the term DNA? [A:] Hans Winkler  [Q:] What is a genome? [A:] a full set of chromosomes in a diploid cell  [Q:] When did Hans create the term? [A:] 1920  [Q:] What was his profession? [A:] , professor of botany  [Q:] Where?

The kitty did not want to freeze, so it found a place to stay warm in a trashcan near a bush. The kitty had been left outside in the rain, but some friendly people thought that they would let it in when they found it in the trashcan outside. They gave the kitty some water to sip, and food to eat. When the phone would ring, the kitty would run and hide. The kitty would hide in the bathroom. Sometimes, the kitty would take its food into the bedroom and eat it there. The kitty's claws were so sharp that they ended up cutting everything that it scratched. The kitty also scratched the finger of one of the nice people. When the rain stopped, the nice people put the kitty back outside. They put it outside because it was making them sneeze. The kitty left their home happy and with a full stomach. All of its kitty friends were waiting for it. [Q:] Who was left outside in the rain?

Julia gets an allowance from her parents every week for different chores she does every day. The big chore she must do is to feed the dog after school. Julia had a busy day at school and had many tests to complete. When she got home, she forgot to feed her dog, Buddy. Her parents had to feed the dog later. The next day, she forgot again. She saw her parents were feeding Buddy for her each night that she forgot to do it. Julia stopped doing her chore because she knew her parents would take care of it for her. Julia used her extra time to play every day after school. At the end of the week, Julia was excited. She had been wanting a new doll that had come out in the stores. Her friends all had them, and she wanted one, too. But at the end of the week, Julia didn't get an allowance. Her parents told her it was because she had not done her big chore all week, and had played instead. Julia did not get the toy she wanted that week.

(CNN) -- Momentum is mounting against the NCAA, the century-old body that governs college sports. 

A federal judge has just heard one case calling for revenue from TV deals to be shared with student athletes and she will likely take on two more landmark suits this year that seek something even bigger -- a free market in college sports. 

At the same time, Northwestern University is appealing a ruling that would allow football players to unionize. 

Here are five things you need to know about what just happened and what's coming. 

The end of some of the biggest traditions? 

National championships. Age-old rivalries. Larger-than-life game day atmospheres. 

That's what's at stake, according to NCAA President Mark Emmert, who described a doomsday scenario if college athletes are paid, when he testified in the case brought by former UCLA basketball star Ed O'Bannon. 

Emmert said many school leaders have told him they would not want to pay for athletes. Instead they might opt out of Division I sports into Division II where there is less money for coaches, facilities and scholarships. 

Schools that did stay in D1 would likely have to cut less popular sports to afford to pay athletes, he said. 

And the schools that chose to pay would probably never play the schools that chose not to pay -- preventing a true national championship and putting an end to traditional rivalry games that are fan favorites, Emmert said. 

But that idea is rejected by one of O'Bannon's lawyers, Bill Isaacson. 

"The millions of sports fans who watch these games and everyone at the networks that broadcasts them knows that the games will continue to be played," he said.

FIFA has decided that the Football World Cup 2018 will be held in Russia. Before the answer was given to the public, many people thought England would be the winner. Famous football player, David Beckham, Prince William and Prime Minister David Cameron all worked hard to help England to hold the Football World Cup 2018. Mr. Cameron promised that England would make every fan feel at home and that it would host the most wonderful Football World Cup in history. David Beckham spoke movingly of how his grandfather, a football fan, died as he was playing in the Football World Cup. FIFA president, Sepp Blatter, described England as "the motherland of football" before he opened the envelope with the winner's name in it. Prince William said, "Certainly we're very disappointed. We have worked hard, but sadly, it didn't work." He added later, "I'm sorry for England football fans. We have given everything we could." Before the answer was given, hundreds of fans had gathered in London and other main English cities in the cold weather in the hope of good news, but the news let them down. The last Football World Cup help in England was the Football World Cup 1966. [Q:] When was the last Football World Cup held in England [A:] 1966.  [Q:] Has England tried to hold it since?

When the love child of the doughnut and the croissant was created by the Dominique Ansel Bakery in New York, fans queued for hours to sample the tasty hybrid snack. 

With only 300 cronuts made each day sold at $5 a pop, they are so coveted that they can go for up to $40 on the pastry black market. Even supermodel Heidi Klum had to wait weeks to try one. 

Though the cronut has gained worldwide attention on social media since its debut in May, few in the UK have had the chance to taste the unique pastry -- until now. 

"It just went viral because it's new," Dominique Ansel told CNN'. "It's fun; it's unusual; it's good." 

One British bakery described it as the most exciting pastry launch since the sausage roll. 

But although they have proved extremely popular with British customers, the intense enthusiasm for cronuts in New York is unlikely to be replicated in London. 

"Cronuts are called "Yum Yums" in this country and you can buy them in [the supermarket Waitrose. We've had them for decades," wrote Richard Turner, the owner of London's Hawksmoor steakhouse, in an email to his business partner. 

Adalat Hussain, co-owner of the Wild and Wood cafe in Central London says British cronut-eaters are attempting to master the treat with a knife and fork. "I think using your hands is the best way," he says. 

Back across the pond, a young woman in the queue outside the Dominique Ansel Bakery declared the cronut a typically American invention.  [Q:] When did the cronut first appear? [A:] May  [Q:] What about "Yum Yums?" [A:] decades agi  [Q:] What are British people trying to use to eat cronuts? [A:] a knife and fork.  [Q:] According to whom? [A:] Adalat Hussain  [Q:] What does he partly own? [A:] Wild and Wood cafe  [Q:] Where is that? [A:] Central London  [Q:] How many cronuts does the New York bakery make daily? [A:] 300  [Q:] What is the bakery's name? [A:] the Dominique Ansel Bakery  [Q:] How much do they sell each pastry for? [A:] $5 a pop  [Q:] True or False: The cronut is a cross between a donut and a muffin. [A:] False  [Q:] What it is a cross between? [A:] doughnut and the croissant  [Q:] Why does Ansel think cronuts got so popular? [A:] it's new  [Q:] What other adjectives did she use to describe it? [A:] fun, unusual and good  [Q:] Where can you buy the British version of a cronut? [A:] supermarket
Last week when I was sitting in my office,I heard an elderly lady talking on the phone about her husband.Her husband's name was Ed.He dropped her off for her doctor's appointment and was going to park the car and wait for her.She was so upset that she started to cry.I knew I should take action. The lady told me her name was Helen and she called the restaurant she and her husband were going to have lunch at after her appointment to see if he was waiting for her there.She explained that she thought her husband parked the car in the parking lot and waited for her in the car but she didn't find him there so she returned to see if he entered the medical building,but Ed was not there either.She regretted making her husband park the car alone since some signs of Alzheimer's had happened in his behavior.I asked a few nurses to help look for Ed inside and outside the medical building according to Helen's description.Then I offered to drive Helen to the restaurant to see if Ed was waiting for her there. On arriving at the parking lot of the restaurant,Helen began to search for Ed's car but she failed,which suggested Ed wasn't there.We decided to have a talk with the manager before we returned to the hospital.On our way to the manager's office.I received a call from a nurse,who said they had found Ed.What a relief! But we still needed to go on searching since he forgot where he parked his car! Fortunately, we didn't have much difficulty finding it.

As Michael put each finger on the white laces of the football like his dad had shown him he thought about his school trip to the zoo tomorrow. He could not wait to get to the zoo and most of all could not wait to see his favorite animal, the lion. Aiming the football at the tire swing that hung in his back yard, he remembered the second thing his dad had taught him about throwing a football which was making sure his shoulder and the football were in a straight line before he threw it. He watched the football sail toward the tire, right as his mom called him in for dinner. His mom had made his favorite food, hotdogs. He sat in the kitchen and watched as ketchup fell on to his plate as he ate his hotdog. His mom told him that in order to get his after dinner treat he would have to eat his corn, carrots, and drink all of his milk too. 

That night as his mom tucked him in to bed he starred out the window and wondered if the lions at the zoo were looking up at the moon too. Michael, wondered if his best friends Joe, Nick, and Ryan were as excited as he was about going to the zoo the next day. He closed his eyes and went to sleep. 

The next day he hopped from one foot to the other as his class lined up to get on the bus that would take him to the zoo. On the bus he sat with Ryan. The bus driver started the engine and turned the big steering wheel leading them out on to the road. Finally, at the zoo Michael began to imagine how cool it would be to finally get to see the lion cage. First his class went to see the monkeys and then headed over to see the long necked giraffes. As their teacher announced that they would then be going to see the elephants, we wondered if he would ever get to see the lions. Finally after learning about the elephants it was time to see the lions. The lion stood on a huge rock and swung its long tail from side to side. The lion licked his lips with its long pink tongue and Michael wondered if it was thinking about having a class full of kids for its lunch. [Q:] What sport was Michael playing? [A:] football  [Q:] What was he throwing the ball at? [A:] a tire swing  [Q:] What was his favorite food? [A:] hotdogs  [Q:] Where was he going the next day?

David and Sue went to their Auntie's house to visit on Saturday morning. She had some new ducklings in the pond that they wanted to see. They went out to the pond and on the way they saw a frog. They also saw a boat in the water. They saw a water lily. They looked in the water until they saw the mother duck and her ducklings. They were different colors. Six of them were brown and yellow. Four of them were only yellow. Two ducklings were brown. There was one that was white. They were all very fuzzy. They went back to the house to tell Auntie Beth about the ducklings. She was cooking on the stove. She asked Sue to get some eggs. She asked David to get some butter. Auntie Beth poured some milk into a bowl of flour. She made them a cake. "I'm so glad you've come to visit me," Auntie Beth said. Sue told her about the things they saw at the pond. David said, "We saw a frog. Don't forget the frog. It was my favorite." It was a good visit. [Q:] When did they go to visit their Aunt? [A:] Saturday morning  [Q:] SHe had some new what? [A:] ducklings  [Q:] What did they see when they went to see them?

A famous building in New York City is turning 100 years old. A year-long celebration is planned for Grand Central Terminal, which is usually called Grand Central station, the sixth most-visited place in the world. The huge building has not changed much since it opened in February, 1913. About 750,000 people pass through Grand Central every day. Some just come to look at it, others to visit the stores. But most are there to catch the trains that enter and leave from the station. It is the largest train station in the world. There are 67 train tracks, all of them underground. The main part of the building has large, arched windows, a jeweled four-sided clock and ticket windows. Grand Central has been seen in many movies through the years. Dan Brucker is with the New York Transit Authority, which operates the station. Dan Brucker has worked for the transit authority at Grand Central for 30 years. In all those years, he has not lost his interest in the building. Justin Ferate, a historian, has been giving tours of Grand Central Station for 30 years. He says the station was designed to make travel a pleasure. "Why people don't run into each other in Grand Central is simple: each block of stone in Grand Central is the length of your leg. Each block of stone in Grand Central is the length of your arm. Each block of stone is a different color, so it's a checkerboard, based on you." A ten-year-long fight against plans to build a huge office building over Grand Central in 1968 helped create the modern preservation movement. Now, no one would think of changing the beauty of the station. [Q:] When did Grand Central Terminal first open? [A:] February, 1913  [Q:] What is it often called?

Christopher Thomas, 27, was a writer by night and a teacher by day when he noticed he was always tired and was losing weight fast. Diagnosed with diabetes , Thomas would need to inject himself with insulin three times a day for the rest of his life or risk nerve damage, blindness, and even death. And if that weren't bad enough, he had no health insurance. After a month of feeling upset, Thomas decided he'd better find a way to fight back. He left Canton, Michigan for New York, got a job waiting tables, nicknamed himself the Diabetic Rockstar , and created diabeticrockstar.com, a free online community for diabetics and their loved ones--a place where over 1,100 people share personal stories, information, and resources. 

Jason Swencki"s son, Kody, was diagnosed with type diabetes at six. Father and son visit the online children's forums together most evenings. "Kody gets so excited, writing to kids from all over," says Swencki, one of the site's volunteers. "They know what he's going through, so he doesn't feel alone." Kody is anything but alone: Diabetes is now the seventh leading cause of death in the United States, with 24 million diagnosed cases. And more people are being diagnosed at younger ages. 

These days, Thomas's main focus is his charity, Fight It, which provides medicines and supplies to people--225 to date--who can't afford a diabetic's huge expenses. Fight-it.org has raised about $23,000--in products and in cash. In May, Thomas will hold the first annual Diabetic Rockstar Festival in the Caribbean. 

Even with a staff of 22 volunteers, Thomas often devotes up to 50 hours a week to his cause, while still doing his full-time job waiting tables. "Of the diabetes charities out there, most are putting money into finding a cure," says Bentley Gubar one of Rockstar's original members. "But Christopher is the only person I know saying people need help now." [Q:] What was Christopher's day job? [A:] teaching  [Q:] What disease was he diagnosed with?

CHAPTER VIII 

ABOUT SOME NEW STUDENTS 

"Hi! hi! what's the meaning of this outrage!" roared the individual in the buggy, as he brought his horse to a standstill. "Do you want to kill me?" 

"Who is it? Is he hurt?" questioned Dave, quickly. 

"I don't know," answered Ben. "The rod took off his hat, but whether it struck his head or not remains to be seen." 

"Wot's the trouble back there?" demanded Jackson Lemond, as he succeeded in bringing his team to a halt. 

"Trouble is, we hit that man with the rod," answered Buster. 

"Humph! I told you to be careful," grumbled the carryall driver. "It don't pay to act like a passel o' wildcats, nohow!" 

"It's too bad it happened," said Dave, and leaped to the ground and ran back to where the buggy stood, with the driver glaring at them savagely. The other students followed. 

"Are you hurt?" asked Dave, anxiously. The man in the buggy was a total stranger to him. 

"Hurt? I don't know whether I am or not. What do you mean by knocking off my hat with that stick?" 

"It was an accident, sir. We had our school colors on the fishing rod and were waving them in the air. We didn't expect to hit anybody." 

"Bah! you are a lot of rowdies!" growled the man. "Give me my hat!" And he pointed to where the head covering rested on some bushes. 

"There you are," said Ben, restoring the hat to its owner. "But we are not rowdies--it was purely an accident," he added, with a little flash out of his clear eyes.  [Q:] Was someone killed? [A:] no  [Q:] What happened to the man in the buggy? [A:] His hat was knocked off  [Q:] Who did that to him? [A:] a group of boys  [Q:] Did they do it on purpose? [A:] no  [Q:] Where did his hat end up? [A:] on some bushes.  [Q:] Did he pick it up himself? [A:] no  [Q:] Who got it for him? [A:] Ben  [Q:] Are the boys trouble makers? [A:] no  [Q:] What were they doing? [A:] Waving their school colors  [Q:] On what? [A:] on the fishing rod  [Q:] How many boys are there? [A:] four  [Q:] Who brought the boys to a halt? [A:] Jackson Lemond  [Q:] Did they know whether or not they hurt the man? [A:] no  [Q:] Did their driver warn them to be careful? [A:] yes  [Q:] Who was the first boy to talk to the man? [A:] Dave  [Q:] What did he say to him? [A:] "Are you hurt?  [Q:] Did he know the man? [A:] no  [Q:] What did the man answer? [A:] "Hurt? I don't know whether I am or not.  [Q:] Did the man realize it was an accident? [A:] no  [Q:] What did he call the group of boys? [A:] a lot of rowdies!"
This year the US will honour one of the country's most famous writers--Mark Twain (1835-1910). Most readers know that his real name was Samuel Longhome Clemens, but how many know where the pen name "Mark Twain" came from? The answer shows Clemens' colorful early life before he became a writer. "Mark Twain" was the cry shouted on a ship when the ship entered a part of a river that was two fathoms (6 feet) deep. "Twain" is an old-fashioned way of saying "two". Twain trained as a ship pilot on the Mississippi river for two years, a time that he wrote about in the humourousLife on the Mississippi (1883). The famous river would become an important theme in many of his works--who could forget the journey of the Huck and Jim along it in his most famous book. The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (1884)? With little education, he had to teach himself how to write stories. Whenever possible, he would go to public libraries. There he spent much time reading and thinking, which greatly helped him with his writing. On the other hand, his life experiences gave him wonderful material to write about and attract readers. Twain wrote in a style that has been called "local colour" because it shows great knowledge of local people and their customs. This _ is very clear in the two books for which Twain is still celebrated today. The Adventures of Tom Sawyer (1876) and its follow-up The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn, which many people call "The Great American Novel". The most amazing invention in the book is the voice of Huck himself. Huck did not enjoy schooling. It shows in the way he uses language, in a spoken style. Only a master like Twain could copy the way a young southern boy talked so well. [Q:] Who is the writer? [A:] Mark Twain  [Q:] What was his name at birth? [A:] Samuel Longhorne Clemens  [Q:] What did he do for a couple of years? [A:] trained as a ship pilot  [Q:] Did he create anything during that time? [A:] yes  [Q:] What was it?

[Update 2:15 p.m. ET] "We are taking precautions to protect elected officials in the county," Kaufman County, Texas, Sheriff David Byrnes said at a news conference Sunday after District Attorney Mike McLelland and his wife, Cynthia, were found dead Saturday in their home. 

[Posted at 9:29 a.m. ET] 

Two months ago, a Texas district attorney vowed to put away the "scum" who had killed one of his top deputies. 

Now, the district attorney and his wife are dead. And authorities aren't sure whether their killings are part of a broader scheme targeting criminal justice officials. 

The bodies of Mike McLelland and his wife, Cynthia, were found Saturday in their home in Kaufman County, east of Dallas. 

"I don't know of anyone who would want to cause him harm," Kaufman city Mayor William Fortner said. "As far as I could tell, he was doing a really good job as a district attorney." 

Fortner said police are taking "extra precautions" to try to ensure no one else is targeted. 

"We lost some important people, and we hope the killers are caught before any more people are lost," he said. 

A law enforcement official told The Dallas Morning News that a door was apparently kicked in, and "there are shell casings everywhere." 

Authorities have not identified a suspect. Nor are they sure whether the deaths are related to the killing of Kaufman County Assistant District Attorney Mark Hasse, who was killed on his way to work in January. 

The county sheriff's office brought in the FBI and the Texas Rangers to help with the investigation.  [Q:] what was Mike McLelland position? [A:] District Attorney  [Q:] where did he live?

The University of Kansas (KU) is a public research university and the largest in the U.S. state of Kansas. KU branch campuses are located in the towns of Lawrence, Wichita, Overland Park, Salina, and Kansas City, Kansas, with the main campus located in Lawrence on Mount Oread, the highest location in Lawrence. Founded March 21, 1865, the university was opened in 1866, under a charter granted by the Kansas State Legislature in 1864 following enabling legislation passed in 1863 under the Kansas State Constitution, adopted two years after the 1861 admission of the former Kansas Territory as the 34th state into the Union following a very famous bloody internal civil war known as "Bleeding Kansas" during the 1850s. 

The university's Medical Center and University Hospital are located in Kansas City, Kansas. The Edwards Campus is in Overland Park, Kansas, in the Kansas City metropolitan area.

CHAPTER LXXI. 

SHEWING WHAT HUGH STANBURY THOUGHT ABOUT THE DUTY OF MAN. 

In the conference which took place between Sir Marmaduke and his wife after the interview between him and Nora, it was his idea that nothing further should be done at all. "I don't suppose the man will come here if he be told not," said Sir Marmaduke, "and if he does, Nora of course will not see him." He then suggested that Nora would of course go back with them to the Mandarins, and that when once there she would not be able to see Stanbury any more. "There must be no correspondence or anything of that sort, and so the thing will die away." But Lady Rowley declared that this would not quite suffice. Mr. Stanbury had made his offer in due form, and must be held to be entitled to an answer. Sir Marmaduke, therefore, wrote the following letter to the "penny-a-liner," mitigating the asperity of his language in compliance with his wife's counsels. 

Manchester Street, April 20th, 186--. 

MY DEAR SIR,-- 

Lady Rowley has told me of your proposal to my daughter Nora; and she has told me also what she learned from you as to your circumstances in life. I need hardly point out to you that no father would be justified in giving his daughter to a gentleman upon so small an income, and upon an income so very insecure. 

I am obliged to refuse my consent, and I must therefore ask you to abstain from visiting and from communicating with my daughter.  [Q:] Who did Sir Marmaduke have a conference with? [A:] his wife  [Q:] Was this before or after his other interview? [A:] after  [Q:] Who was that one with? [A:] Nora  [Q:] Who would Nora be forbidden to see? [A:] Stanbury  [Q:] Where would she go? [A:] Mandarins  [Q:] Would she be allowed to write Stanbury? [A:] no  [Q:] Did Lady Rowley agree to this arrangement? [A:] no  [Q:] Why not? [A:] Mr. Stanbury was entitled to an answer.  [Q:] Who proposed? [A:] Mr. Stanbury  [Q:] To whom? [A:] Nora  [Q:] Why wasn't she being allowed to marry him? [A:] small income  [Q:] Was it secure, albeit small? [A:] no  [Q:] Who is Nora's father? [A:] Sir Marmaduke
One summer when I was sixteen, I planted a vegetable garden. I wanted a bunch of different vegetables, so I planted seven tomato plants, three pepper plants, six corn plants, and two cucumber plants. My mom loves zucchini so I also planted ten zucchini plants. I watered the garden daily with a watering can. When weeds started to take over, I pulled them back. About a month in, I started getting fresh vegetables every day. I walked to the garden with a big basket every morning and picked the vegetables that were ready. Sometimes I ate them right off the vine. One day I walked down to the garden and saw that the zucchini plants were taking over. Each of my ten plants had many zucchini, giving me hundreds of zucchinis each week. I didn't know what to do with the zucchini so I gave some to my neighbor. I gave some to my parents to take to their friends. Then I went door to door and gave zucchini to everyone in the neighborhood. [Q:] How were they when they planted the garden?

Greta ran to the corner with her older brother Tony. He had money for the ice cream truck in his pocket and she was very happy. The ice cream truck had been parked at the curb waiting for children for a very long time. The ice cream truck driver thought that no more children were coming to get ice cream so he started pulling away from the curb when they got to the corner. They yelled. They screamed, "Stop! Stop!" and jumped up and down on the side walk trying to get him to see them. The driver of the truck saw them, waved at them and smiled, pulled back to the curb and opened his truck up so that they could see everything that he had for sale. They were so excited. They saw some new treats. Tony wanted to try something new. He got an ice cream sundae with chocolate ice cream and nuts. He almost got a snow cone. Greta looked at everything that the ice cream truck had. She saw candy, ice cream cones, snow cones, and everything else. It all looked so good. But after looking at everything, she wanted to get an ice cream sandwich. She got the ice cream sandwich. She bit into it and smiled. It tasted so good. She felt so happy. Her brother, Tony, was happy too. He bit into his ice cream cone sundae and grinned. They walked home with their ice cream and told their mom about how close they came to not getting their ice cream at all. Their mom was happy that the truck had stopped for them. She said that they were very lucky to have gotten to the curb before the ice cream truck left. [Q:] Did the ice cream truck start to leave? [A:] Yes  [Q:] how did the kids get its attention?

Posted: 06/19/2014 12:00 a.m. Lucy Li, an 11-year-old girl, is the youngest person to qualify for a US Women's Open golf tournament . She was qualified for the US Women's Open in May. When she set a new record by seven strokes .And today she is playing against some of the best female golfers in the world. Earlier this week Li said that she wasn't nervous about becoming the centre of attention at today's game. "I just want to have fun and play the best I can and I really don't care about the result. I can learn a lot from these great players." Li doesn't spend all her time golfing. She is home-schooled in an online Stanford University programme. Her favourite subjects are Maths, History, and Science and she loves to read. She also loves medicine, diving, badminton, dancing, and table tennis. But golf is her favourite sport. "I like golf because it's different from other sports. Anybody can play it." she said. Some female golfers are worried that Li isn't quite ready for the Open. "When I found out she was qualified, I said, where does she go from here? You qualify for an Open at 11, what do you do next? If she was my kid, I wouldn't let her play in the US Open at all, but that's just me," said world champion Stacy Lewis. Dottie Pepper, an ESPN analyst , thinks that the most important thing is that Li doesn't think of winning. "If the success for her is not based on score, then I don't think she's too young. The important thing for her is to treat the whole experience as a kid on the golf score. Forget expectations." Dottie said. [Q:] Is Li schooled at home? [A:] Yes  [Q:] With what university is her online school affiliated with? [A:] Stanford  [Q:] What sport does she play? [A:] golf  [Q:] What tournament has she qualified for? [A:] the US Women's Open  [Q:] What is her age? [A:] 11  [Q:] In what month did she qualify for the tournament? [A:] May  [Q:] Did she set at record at that time? [A:] yes  [Q:] By how many strokes? [A:] seven  [Q:] Was she the youngest ever to qualify for the tournament? [A:] Yes  [Q:] What are her favorite school subjects? [A:] Maths, History, and Science  [Q:] Who said that Li shouldn't play in the Open? [A:] Stacy Lewis  [Q:] Who is Dottie Pepper? [A:] an ESPN analyst  [Q:] What does she think the girl should not think of? [A:] winning  [Q:] Did Li say she was nervous about getting attention in the sport? [A:] no  [Q:] What did she say she did not care about? [A:] the result  [Q:] Does Li like to dance? [A:] Yes  [Q:] Why did she say she liked golf as opposed to other sports? [A:] Anybody can play it
Israel was happy, very happy. The news of a deal to bring home the kidnapped soldier Gilad Shalit , a young man held prisoner by Hamas for five years,spread. But the happiness was hardened by the reality of the price Israelis had paid to set him free. The 1,027 Palestinian prisoners to be exchanged for the single Israeli corporal turned out to include men and women convicted of some of the worst terrorist attacks in the country. "Ambivalent," says Aya Ilouz, of her feelings on the matter. Strolling in downtown Jerusalem with her husband Liron and their 5-month-old daughter Yael, the couple is so in sync on the question of the day that they finish each other's thoughts. "Yes," says Liron, "we are very happy and excited to see Gilad meet his family. And on the other hand--" "We are very concerned," says Aya. "About what happens next," Liron explains. "When the next terrorist blows himself up, someone will have to answer." Just around the corner, on King George Street, Alan Bauer had been walking home with his son on March 21, 2002, when a Palestinian man named Mohammad Hashaika exploded a suicide vest packed with metal scraps. Eighty-four people were wounded that day. Of the three killed, one was a woman pregnant with twins. Though the bomber of course died, Israeli courts convicted the two women who drove him to the site of the bombing, easing his way past the Israeli checkpoint by buying flowers to carry in the Mother's Day crowd. "These women, as I speak, are being released," Bauer says. Specifics have a way of weakening the joy of Shalit's release. Among the 477 prisoners released on Tuesday, in the first phase of the exchange, are an organizer of the 2002 Passover bombing that killed 30 people; a woman who developed an online relationship with a lovesick Israeli youth she then had murdered when he came to meet her; and the man who proudly displayed his bloody hands to the mob gathered outside the Ramallah building where two Israeli soldiers were beaten to death after making a wrong turn on Oct. 12, 2000. When the list became public, s of terrorism victims appealed, without success, to Israel's supreme court to prevent the prisoner exchange. The court hearing was interrupted repeatedly by upset survivors, including Shvuel Schijveschuurder, who lost five of his family members in a 2001 attack at a Jerusalem Sbarro. To protest the release of the woman who drove the suicide bomber to the pizza restaurant, Schijveschuurder poured paint on a memorial to Yitzhak Rabin, the Prime Minister slain by an Israeli extremist for signing the Oslo Accords. "When we say 1,027 prisoners will be released, it's abstract, it doesn't mean anything," says Eliad Moreh Rosenberg, who was wounded in the 2002 terrorism bombing at the Hebrew University cafeteria. "But for victims of terror, it's a reality." Israeli officials calculate that 60% of those released resume terrorism attacks. To help prevent that resumption this time around, Israel insisted that most of the prisoners liberated be sent either to the Gaza Strip -- which is sealed off from Israel and under the control of Hamas, which says it continues to observe a cease-fire -- or into exile in Turkey, Qatar or Syria. About 100 arrived in the West Bank, where the government led by Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas works diligently to suppress terrorism, cooperating with Israeli intelligence and military. With the future uncertain, on Tuesday, Jewish Israelis stopped and stared at televisions wherever they came upon them. On the sidewalk at midmorning outside the 24-hour Hillel Market, 50 people were gathered under a flat screen to catch the first images of Shalit, looking painfully thin . "It was moving. It was very exciting," says Anat Rubin, 42. "I just saw photos of him getting out of the car. It gave me chills." But she says she heard Hamas say that, learning from success, it was keen to kidnap more Israelis in order to win freedom for the 6,000 Palestinians still in Israeli prisons. "I don't want to see the photos of them doing the V for victory," she says. "Like they won. They are really releasing murderers. I'm happy and sad all together." [Q:] Who was kidnapped?

The Labrador has won the honor of the most popular breed for the past eighteen years. It has been described as gentle, clever and friendly. Yet not all Labs are the same. 

John Grogan discovered _ after he and his wife adopted a Labrador that they named Marley. The dog caused Mr. Grogan a lot of trouble, but it also provided many stories for his newspaper articles. Later, he wrote a best-selling book, "Marley and Me: Life and Love with the World's Worst Dog." 

Marley was happy and fun-loving. But he was also extremely large and difficult to control. He bit anything that he could find around the house, including plastic, clothing and jewelry. And he had a great fear of loud noises, especially thunderstorms. Unfortunately, the Grogans lived in Florida where many thunderstorms develop. Marley would attack the furniture, walls and doors until his feet bled if he was left alone in the house during a thunderstorm. Marley almost damaged their home several times. 

John Grogan said that at first he considered that probably his dog could be trained to be a show champion. But he soon realized that was impossible. Marley didn't like to learn skills that didn't belong to dogs, and he was driven out of the dog training school for causing troubles for other dogs. He didn't want to hide his emotions. He would show his anger and tiredness if he felt them. 

Even if that, Marley still had earned a place in the Grogans'. He didn't know how to dance, and he didn't know how to walk on its two legs, but he was what he was. He would never be a Lassie or a Benji or an old Yeller for he would never like to take part in a dog show, but the Grogans accepted him and loved him very much. [Q:] What book did John write? [A:] "Marley and Me: Life and Love with the World's Worst Dog."  [Q:] After his experience with whom? [A:] Marley.  [Q:] What kind of animal was he? [A:] A dog.  [Q:] What breed?

[A:] anything that he could find  [Q:] Where did his family live? [A:] Florida  [Q:] How does Marley's breed rank in terms of popularity? [A:] the most popular  [Q:] How long have they held that rank? [A:] eighteen years.  [Q:] Are labs usually smart? [A:] yes  [Q:] Did Marley like to learn? [A:] no  [Q:] Ultimately, was Marley a happy dog? [A:] yes
There once was a wolf that liked to scare the other forest animals. By daylight he pretended to be a kind, nice wolf. By night, he would circle the forest and hunt down his food. When he was very hungry, he would find humans and woof like a dog in hopes that someone would feed him. The wolf's favorite food was meat seasoned with lemon. The wolf liked to watch his food run in circles like a hamster until he felt like eating it. Sometimes the wolf would stay in the sand and lay in the sun until he would crawl back to his home and fall asleep with a full stomach. On other days, he goes home hungry. Sometimes there would be a knock on his door, and the wolf would be pleased because it meant his dinner had come to him and he would not have to hunt that day. Those days were the best for the wolf, by far. [Q:] Who liked to scare other animals? [A:] a wolf  [Q:] What kind of animals were these?

As we drove along, my spirits went up again, and I turned, with pleasure, to the thought of the new life which I was entering. But though it was not far past the middle of September, the heavy clouds and strong north-easterly wind combined to make the day extremely cold; and the journey seemed a very long one, so that it was nearly one o'clock before we reached the place of our destination. Yet when we entered the gateway, my heart failed me, and I wished it were a mile or two farther off. For the first time in my life I must stand alone: there was no retreating now. I must enter that house, and introduce myself among its strange people. But how was it to be done? True, I was near nineteen; but, thanks to the protecting care of my mother and sister, I well knew that many a girl of fifteen, or under, was gifted with a more womanly address, and greater ease and self-possession, than I was. Yet, anyway. I would do very well, after all; and the children, of course, I should soon be at ease with them. 

"Be calm, be calm, whatever happens," I said within myself; and truly I was so fully occupied in steadying my nerves and keeping down the rebellious beat of my heart that when I was admitted into the hall and into the presence of Mrs. Bloomfield, I almost forgot to answer her polite greeting; and it afterwards struck me that the little I did say was spoken in the tone of one half-dead or half-asleep. 

With due politeness, however, she showed me my bedroom, and left me there to take a little refreshment for a little while and led me into the dining-room. Some beefsteaks and potatoes were set before me; and while I dined upon these, she sat opposite, watching me (as I thought) and trying to keep something like a conversation-- consisting chiefly of commonplace remarks. In fact, my attention was almost wholly absorbed in my dinner: not from appetite, but from the toughness of the beefsteaks, and the numbness of my hands. 

"I have had so little time to attend to their education myself, but I think they are clever children, and very willing to learn, especially the little boy; he is, I think, the flower of the flock-- a generous, noble-spirited boy, one to be led, but not driven, and remarkable for always speaking the truth." "His sister Mary Ann will require watching," continued she, "but she is a very good girl on the whole, though I wish her to be kept out of the nursery as much as possible, as she is now almost six years old, and might acquire bad habits from the nurses. I have ordered her bed to be placed in your room, and if you will be so kind as to look after her washing and dressing, and take charge of her clothes, she needs to have nothing further to do with the nursery maid." 

I replied I was quite willing to do so; and at that moment the children entered the room. Tom Bloomfield was a well-grown boy of seven. Mary was a tall girl, for her age of six, somewhat dark like her mother. The second sister was Fanny, a very pretty little girl, looking little younger than Mary. The remaining one was Harriet, a little broad, fat, merry, playful thing of scarcely two, whom I had more desire for than all the rest -- but with her I had nothing to do. [Q:] What time of year was it? [A:] not far past the middle of September  [Q:] how was the weather? [A:] extremely cold  [Q:] What time did they reach the destination? [A:] nearly one o'clock  [Q:] What did she need to do first? [A:] enter the house  [Q:] and then? [A:] introduce herself  [Q:] What was she doing there? [A:] to teach her children  [Q:] Who's children? [A:] Mrs. Bloomfield's  [Q:] How many? [A:] four  [Q:] Which was known for speaking the truth?

CHAPTER V 

The day after the little conference at John's, Felix had indeed received the following note: 

"DEAR FELIX: 

"When you go down to see old Tod, why not put up with us at Becket? Any time will suit, and the car can take you over to Joyfields when you like. Give the pen a rest. Clara joins in hoping you'll come, and Mother is still here. No use, I suppose, to ask Flora. 

"Yours ever, 

"STANLEY." 

During the twenty years of his brother's sojourn there Felix had been down to Becket perhaps once a year, and latterly alone; for Flora, having accompanied him the first few times, had taken a firm stand. 

"My dear," she said, "I feel all body there." 

Felix had rejoined: 

"No bad thing, once in a way." 

But Flora had remained firm. Life was too short! She did not get on well with Clara. Neither did Felix feel too happy in his sister-in-law's presence; but the gray top-hat instinct had kept him going there, for one ought to keep in touch with one's brothers. 

He replied to Stanley: 

"DEAR STANLEY: 

"Delighted; if I may bring my two youngsters. We'll arrive to-morrow at four-fifty. 

"Yours affectionately, 

"FELIX." 

Travelling with Nedda was always jolly; one could watch her eyes noting, inquiring, and when occasion served, have one's little finger hooked in and squeezed. Travelling with Alan was convenient, the young man having a way with railways which Felix himself had long despaired of acquiring. Neither of the children had ever been at Becket, and though Alan was seldom curious, and Nedda too curious about everything to be specially so about this, yet Felix experienced in their company the sensations of a new adventure.  [Q:] who invited felix to stay with them? [A:] Stanley  [Q:] did flora and clara get along? [A:] No  [Q:] how many times a year does felix visit Becket? [A:] once a year  [Q:] how many children does he have? [A:] two  [Q:] what did he get after the conference at John's? [A:] A note from Stanley  [Q:] what did Stanley want him to do with his pen? [A:] Give it a rest  [Q:] does Flora usually go with him to visit Stanley? [A:] no  [Q:] Did felix get along with his sister-in-law? [A:] No  [Q:] did he reply to the invite? [A:] Yes  [Q:] who did he say he would bring? [A:] his two youngsters  [Q:] what are there names? [A:] Alan and Nedda  [Q:] what time were they set to arrive? [A:] four-fifty.

(CNN) -- Radical Islamic websites Wednesday posted an Arab Spring audio message purportedly recorded by Osama bin Laden shortly before he was killed. 

The recording, which is more than 12 minutes long and was released by al Qaeda's media arm, As-Sahab, lists the speaker as bin Laden and calls him "the martyr of Islam." 

The audio begins with a prayer and remarks reportedly made by bin Laden about anti-government protests and uprisings earlier this year in several African and Middle East countries. 

CNN, which translated the audio, could not confirm its authenticity. 

The Islamic date with the audio indicates it was recorded between April 4 and May 3. 

Its posting came one day before U.S. President Barack Obama was to deliver a speech highlighting his administration's revised policies toward the Arab region in the wake of the Arab Spring protests.

Just last week, a U.S. official told CNN a message with similar topics was seized at bin Laden's Pakistan compound during the May 2 raid by U.S. commandos. 

The official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the classified nature of the information, has not yet compared the recordings. 

The audio on the websites calls for solidarity among Muslims. 

"My Muslim Umma (nation), we are monitoring with you this great historic event, and we join you with your joy and delight, so congratulations on your victories, and may God have mercy on your martyrs. May He cure your injured and grant the release of your prisoners."  [Q:] What was posted online? [A:] an audio message purportedly recorded by Osama bin Laden  [Q:] When did he record the message?

Guam (i/ˈɡwɑːm/ or /ˈɡwɒm/; Chamorro: Guåhån;[needs IPA] formally the Territory of Guam) is an unincorporated and organized territory of the United States. Located in the northwestern Pacific Ocean, Guam is one of five American territories with an established civilian government. The capital city is Hagåtña, and the most populous city is Dededo. In 2015, 161,785 people resided on Guam. Guamanians are American citizens by birth. Guam has an area of 544 km2 (210 sq mi) and a density of 297/km² (770/sq mi). It is the largest and southernmost of the Mariana Islands, and the largest island in Micronesia. Among its municipalities, Mongmong-Toto-Maite has the highest density at 1,425/km² (3,691/sq mi), whereas Inarajan and Umatac have the lowest density at 47/km² (119/sq mi). The highest point is Mount Lamlam at 406 meters (1,332 ft) above sea level. 

The Chamorros, Guam's indigenous people, settled the island approximately 4,000 years ago. Portuguese explorer Ferdinand Magellan was the first European to visit the island on March 6, 1521. Guam was colonized in 1668 with settlers, like Diego Luis de San Vitores, a Catholic missionary. Between the 1500s and the 1700s, Guam was an important stopover for the Spanish Manila Galleons. During the Spanish–American War, the United States captured Guam on June 21, 1898. Under the Treaty of Paris, Spain ceded Guam to the United States on December 10, 1898. Guam is amongst the seventeen Non-Self-Governing Territories of the United Nations. [Q:] Who is this place a part of? [A:] United States.  [Q:] What sea is it in? [A:] Pacific Ocean  [Q:] Which part?

CHAPTER XIX. 

Now alone, Bathurst threw himself down among the bashes in an attitude of utter depression. 

"Why wasn't I killed with the others?" he groaned. "Why was I not killed when I sat there by her side?" 

So he lay for an hour, and then slowly rose and looked round. There was a faint light in the sky. 

"It will be light in another hour," he said to himself, and he again sat down. Suddenly he started. Had someone spoken, or had he fancied it? 

"Wait till I come." 

He seemed to hear the words plainly, just as he had heard Rujub's summons before. 

"That's it; it is Rujub. How is it that he can make me hear in this way? I am sure it was his voice. Anyhow, I will wait. It shows he is thinking of me, and I am sure he will help me. I know well enough I could do nothing by myself." 

Bathurst assumed with unquestioning faith that Isobel Hannay was alive. He had no reason for his confidence. That first shower of grape might have killed her as it killed others, but he would not admit the doubt in his mind. Wilson's description of what had happened while he was insensible was one of the grounds of this confidence. 

He had heard women scream. Mrs. Hunter and her daughter were the only other women in the boat. Isobel would not have screamed had those muskets been pointed at her, nor did he think the others would have done so. They screamed when they saw the natives about to murder those who were with them. The three women were sitting together, and if one had fallen by the grape shot all would probably have been killed. He felt confident, therefore, that she had escaped; he believed he would have known it had she been killed.  [Q:] Who was groaning? [A:] Bathurst  [Q:] Why was he upset? [A:] He wanted to be killed  [Q:] Who did he think was still alive? [A:] Isobel  [Q:] Where was she? [A:] In the boat  [Q:] How many women were on it? [A:] Three  [Q:] Were they together? [A:] Yes  [Q:] What had they done when they were threatened? [A:] Screamed  [Q:] Who posed a danger to those people? [A:] The natives  [Q:] What were they about to do? [A:] Murder those who were with them  [Q:] With what? [A:] Muskets  [Q:] Were they pointed at her? [A:] No  [Q:] Why did he think they weren't? [A:] She would not have screamed  [Q:] In light of what happened, how was he feeling? [A:] confident  [Q:] What time of day was it? [A:] About an hour before the comes up
Bill Gates was born on October 28th, 1955. He grew up in Seattle, Washington. Bill Gates was named William Henry after his father and grandfather. He was a very clever boy. His favourite subject at school were science and maths. When he was 13 years old, Bill started to play with computers. At that time, computers were very large machines. Once he was interested in a very old computer. He and some of his friends spent lots of time doing unusual things with it. In the end, they worked out a software programme with the old machine. Bill sold it for 4, 200 dollars when he was only 17. In 1973, Bill went to Harvard University. At Harvard, he developed the BASIC language for the first microcomputer . In his third year, he left Harvard to work for a company called Microsoft. Bill began this company in 1975 with his friend Paul Allen. They thought that the computer would be a very important tool in every office and in every home, so they began developing software for personal computers. They improved the software to make it easier for people to use computer. [Q:] Who is the story about? [A:] Bill Gates  [Q:] When was he born? [A:] October 28th, 1955  [Q:] Where?

The 2008 Summer Olympics torch relay was run from March 24 until August 8, 2008, prior to the 2008 Summer Olympics, with the theme of "one world, one dream". Plans for the relay were announced on April 26, 2007, in Beijing, China. The relay, also called by the organizers as the "Journey of Harmony", lasted 129 days and carried the torch 137,000 km (85,000 mi) – the longest distance of any Olympic torch relay since the tradition was started ahead of the 1936 Summer Olympics. 

After being lit at the birthplace of the Olympic Games in Olympia, Greece on March 24, the torch traveled to the Panathinaiko Stadium in Athens, and then to Beijing, arriving on March 31. From Beijing, the torch was following a route passing through six continents. The torch has visited cities along the Silk Road, symbolizing ancient links between China and the rest of the world. The relay also included an ascent with the flame to the top of Mount Everest on the border of Nepal and Tibet, China from the Chinese side, which was closed specially for the event.

CHAPTER XXIV 

A NEW ARRIVAL 

After the disappearance of Jarley Bangs the Rover boys and their chums continued their trip on horseback. 

"Let's move over the hill in the direction of the Bimbel ranch," suggested Spouter. "I'd like to get a bird's-eye view of that outfit." 

"Perhaps we had better not go too close," advised Fred. "Bimbel may be getting out a shotgun for us." 

"I guess it isn't as bad as all that, Fred. Those things might have happened years ago when the country was more sparsely settled and when there were more bad men around. I don't take much stock in what Bangs said. Probably he and Bimbel have quarreled. He struck me as being a man who could get into a dispute very easily." 

"Oh, I was only fooling," answered Fred. "I wouldn't be afraid to ride right up to his door. That is, in the daytime. Of course, if we did it at night he might become suspicious." 

"Say, do you fellows know that it's five minutes to twelve?" questioned Andy, after consulting his watch. "I move that we keep our eyes open for some place where we can take it easy and have lunch." 

"And I second the commotion," returned his brother, joking in a way their father had made familiar to them. 

The boys rode on for half an hour longer, and then reached the top of the hill they were ascending. Here they could look a long distance in all directions. 

"Some view, I'll say," declared Jack, as he surveyed the panorama. "What a picture for an artist to paint!" and he pointed to the majestic mountains to the westward.  [Q:] Who thought they shouldn't get too close to the Bimbel ranch? [A:] Fred  [Q:] What was he worried about? [A:] that he may be getting out a shotgun  [Q:] What time was it? [A:] five minutes to twelve  [Q:] What did Andy want them to watch for? [A:] a place to take it easy and have lunch  [Q:] Who agreed with him? [A:] his brother  [Q:] How much longer before they reach the top of a hill? [A:] half an hour  [Q:] What could they do there? [A:] look a long distance in all directions  [Q:] Who thought it was a view worth painting? [A:] Jack  [Q:] Which direction did he point? [A:] westward  [Q:] Towards what?

CHAPTER NINETEEN. 

A SHOOTING TRIP TO PARADISE ISLE, AND FURTHER DISPLAY OF THE CAPTAIN'S CONTRIVANCES. 

While our explorers were thus reduced to a state of forced inaction as regarded the main object of their expedition, they did not by any means waste their time in idleness. On the contrary, each of the party went zealously to work in the way that was most suitable to his inclination. 

After going over the main island of Poloe as a united party, and ascertaining its size, productions, and general features, the Captain told them they might now do as they pleased. For his part he meant to spend a good deal of his time in taking notes and observations, questioning the chief men as to the lands lying to the northward, repairing and improving the hut, and helping the natives miscellaneously so as to gain their regard. 

Of course Leo spent much of his time with his rifle, for the natives were not such expert hunters but that occasionally they were badly off for food. Of course, also, Alf shouldered his botanical box and sallied forth hammer in hand, to "break stones," as Butterface put it. Benjy sometimes followed Alf--more frequently Leo, and always carried his father's double-barrelled shot-gun. He preferred that, because his powers with the rifle were not yet developed. Sometimes he went with Toolooha, or Tekkona, or Oblooria, in one of the native oomiaks to fish. At other times he practised paddling in the native kayak, so that he might accompany Chingatok on his excursions to the neighbouring islands after seals and wild-fowl.  [Q:] Which chapter is this? [A:] NINETEEN  [Q:] Who is first mentioned? [A:] the explorers  [Q:] Are they able to be active? [A:] no  [Q:] With regard to what? [A:] the main object of their expedition  [Q:] Were they lazy? [A:] no  [Q:] What was gone over? [A:] Poloe  [Q:] What is that? [A:] an island  [Q:] An insignificant one? [A:] the main one  [Q:] What is discussed? [A:] that they could do as they pleased  [Q:] What aspects of it are compared? [A:] its size, productions, and general features  [Q:] Did they do this together? [A:] yes  [Q:] Who speaks to them? [A:] the Captain  [Q:] Were the native people good at hunting? [A:] no  [Q:] Who helps them? [A:] Leo  [Q:] Using what? [A:] his rifle  [Q:] What does someone else use? [A:] a double-barrelled shot-gun  [Q:] Who's is it? [A:] his father's  [Q:] Why does he use it?

RCA Records is an American record label owned by Sony Music, a subsidiary of Sony Corporation of America. It is one of SME's three flagship record labels, alongside Columbia Records and Epic Records. The label has released multiple genres of music, including pop, rock, hip hop, electronic, R&B, blues, jazz, and country. The company's name is derived from the initials of the label's former parent company, the Radio Corporation of America (RCA). It is the second oldest recording company in US history, after sister label Columbia Records. RCA's Canadian unit (formerly Berliner Gramophone Canada) is Sony's oldest label in Canada. It was one of only two Canadian record companies to survive the Great Depression. 

Artists currently signed to RCA Records include Britney Spears, Shakira, Christina Aguilera, Miley Cyrus, Justin Timberlake, Alicia Keys, Usher, Charlie Wilson, R. Kelly, Enrique Iglesias, Foo Fighters, Kings of Leon, Kesha, Chris Brown, D'Angelo, Pink, Walk the Moon, Pitbull and Zayn. 

In 1929, the Radio Corporation of America (RCA) purchased the Victor Talking Machine Company, then the world's largest manufacturer of phonographs (including the famous "Victrola") and phonograph records (in British English, "gramophone records"). The company then became RCA Victor but retained use of the Victor Records name on their labels until the beginning of 1946 when the labels were finally switched over to RCA Victor. With Victor, RCA acquired New World rights to the famous Nipper "His Master's Voice" trademark; in Shanghai, China, RCA Victor was the main competitor with Baak Doi (EMI). Singer Carmen Miranda was signed to RCA Victor Brazilian branch, in 1929 to 1935, when she was still only known in Brazil. [Q:] who are some artists currently working with RCA?

(CNN) -- We should all be so lucky to have friends like Elvis Cole and Joe Pike. Private detectives in modern-day Los Angeles, they're the stars of best-selling author Robert Crais' award-winning series of crime novels. Elvis and Joe have been busting bad guys and thrilling millions of readers since 1987's "The Monkey's Raincoat." The books are international bestsellers, published in 42 countries, and have developed a fervent following. 

In "Taken," Crais's newest novel, his 15th featuring the daring duo, Elvis and Joe take on an especially bloodthirsty group of criminals called bajadores. They are bandits who prey on other bandits along the U.S.-Mexico border, dealing in drugs, murder and kidnapping. 

"Taken" is intense and fast-paced and reads like a big-budget Hollywood blockbuster. Though that's not surprising when you consider Crais began his career writing for television series like "Hill Street Blues," "Cagney & Lacey" and "Miami Vice." 

CNN recently spoke to the author about his new book, his loyal fans and why he's refused to bring Elvis and Joe to the big screen. The following is an edited transcript. 

CNN: How has writing about Elvis Cole and Joe Pike changed over the course of the series? 

Crais: I really strive to bring something new to each book. I don't want to write the same book over and over again. I've done Elvis books; I've done Joe books; I've done mixed books, but this time, I made a conscious decision I wanted to tell a story where I could split the book pretty much down the middle and give them 50-50 equal footing so they both have their starring roles. When I discovered this particular story, it just seemed a perfect way to do that. Part of the book, they're working together. Then there's Elvis' track through the story, and there's Joe track, where he's trying to find Elvis and save him. So it just seemed like an ideal way to let these guys share the stage.

North Dakota (; locally ) is a state in the midwestern and northern regions of the United States. It is the 19th most extensive, but the 4th least populous, and the 4th most sparsely populated of the 50 U.S. states. North Dakota was admitted as the 39th state to the Union on November 2, 1889. The state capital is Bismarck, and the largest city is Fargo. 

North Dakota weathered the Great Recession of the early 21st century with a boom in natural resources, particularly a boom in oil extraction from the Bakken formation, which lies beneath the northwestern part of the state. The development drove strong job and population growth, and low unemployment. However, falling oil prices have put pressure on state finances, leading to questions about the lack of diversity in the North Dakota economy and its vulnerability to commodity price swings. 

North Dakota is in the U.S. region known as the Great Plains. The state shares the Red River of the North with Minnesota to the east. South Dakota is to the south, Montana is to the west, and the Canadian provinces of Saskatchewan and Manitoba are to the north. North Dakota is situated near the middle of North America with a stone marker in Rugby, North Dakota marking the "Geographic Center of the North American Continent". With an area of , North Dakota is the 19th largest state. [Q:] What region is this state in? [A:] midwestern  [Q:] What river does it have? [A:] Red River  [Q:] What state is below it?

(CNN) -- His was a suicide with a macabre twist. In February, former Chicago Bears safety David Duerson shot himself in the chest, but not before leaving behind a note requesting his brain be studied for evidence of a disease striking football players. 

The plaintive note read, "Please, see that my brain is given to the NFL's brain bank." 

Today, scientists announced that Duerson's brain tissue showed "moderately advanced" evidence of chronic traumatic encephalopathy, a dementia-like brain disease afflicting athletes exposed to repeated brain trauma. 

"Dave Duerson had classic pathology of CTE and no evidence of any other disease," said Dr. Ann McKee, a neuropathologist with the Bedford VA Medical Center, and co-director of the Boston University School of Medicine Center for the Study of Traumatic Encephalopathy. "He had severe involvement of areas that control judgment, inhibition, impulse control, mood and memory." 

CTE has been found in the brains of 14 of 15 former NFL players thus far studied at the center. Their cases share a common thread -- repeated concussions, sub-concussive blows to the head, or both. The picture beginning to emerge from these cases is that trauma could be causing brain damage. 

A brain with CTE is riddled with dense clumps of a protein called tau. Under a microscope, tau appears as brown tangles that look similar to dementia. Except the cases of CTE have shown this progressive, dementia-like array in players well in advance of a typical dementia diagnosis, which typically occurs in the 70s or 80s. 

Mike Webster, an offensive lineman with the Pittsburgh Steelers whose CTE was also diagnosed posthumously, was 50 when he died. John Grimsley, a nine-year NFL veteran who played most of his career with the Houston Oilers, was 45, and Duerson was 50. Scientists at Boston University have found evidence of CTE in the brain of an athlete as young as 18.  [Q:] What did David want done with his brain? [A:] given to the NFL's brain bank  [Q:] what parts of his brains were discovered to be affected? [A:] brain tissue  [Q:] what disease did this show he had?

(CNN) -- Brad Pitt clearly has a great deal going on. 

Between being dad to six children, a fiancÃ©, an activist and a perfume pitchman, he still manages to squeeze in some time acting. The movie star recently sat down with "Showbiz Tonight's" A.J. Hammer to talk about his latest project, the mob film "Killing Them Softly," and that nagging question of when he plans to marry partner Angelina Jolie. 

A.J. Hammer: Brad, we've got a mob movie and I believe the first one we've seen that has political campaign speeches throughout it. 

Brad Pitt: I like to mix it up. 

Hammer: Was this -- for you -- as much about making a mob movie as it was about sending a political message? 

Pitt: This is a good friend of mine, the writer and director, Andrew Dominik, he's from Australia, and his view of America was very interesting to me. His feeling in some way oppressed and that we get caught up in trying to sell the idea that the image is more important than the actual substance. This is what he was trying to tell with this story. He finds this book about a crime syndicate, and he makes these comparisons to -- not politics, per se, or not just politics, but ... the financial crisis itself, and it was a good subject matter. 

Hammer: I know, and timely! The idea of the mob dealing with corporate concerns or falling off a fiscal cliff. How timely is that coming off this political season?  [Q:] How many children does he have? [A:] Six.  [Q:] Who is he talking to? [A:] A.J. Hammer.  [Q:] What show were they on? [A:] Showbiz Tonight.  [Q:] What were they talking about?

One day, my family took a vacation to the beach. We were in our car for over 10 hours but it felt like we were in the car for maybe 11, 12, or 13 hours! We thought it would only be 8 hours, but we got lost. My mom and dad were in the front seat, and my sister and I were in the back seat. My sister and I were very bored, but we had to sit still and stay quiet for a lot of the time because our dad needed to be a good driver. My sister and I played with our dolls, or we tried to play easy games. I could not read or eat in the car because I felt too sick. My sister spilled Coke on the car and my mom spanked her with a glove. The look of sadness on my sister's face almost made me cry, too! We got to the ocean so late at night, but we took a nice walk next to the ocean and then we went to bed. We were so tired from doing nothing all day! The next morning we woke up early and ran to the beach and we saw so many animals! We saw dolphins, turtles, and fish! We were hoping to see a shark, but I'm glad we did not. When it was lunch time we played with some chalk and mother made lunch. I was very happy and had a great vacation! [Q:] Who went to the beach?

Lublin Voivodeship, or Lublin Province (in Polish, "województwo lubelskie" ), is a voivodeship, or province, located in southeastern Poland. It was created on January 1, 1999, out of the former Lublin, Chełm, Zamość, Biała Podlaska and (partially) Tarnobrzeg and Siedlce Voivodeships, pursuant to Polish local government reforms adopted in 1998. The province is named after its largest city and regional capital, Lublin, and its territory is made of four historical lands: the western part of the voivodeship, with Lublin itself, belongs to Lesser Poland, the eastern part of Lublin Area belongs to Red Ruthenia, and the northeast belongs to Polesie and Podlasie. 

Lublin Voivodeship is bordered by Subcarpathian Voivodeship to the south, Świętokrzyskie Voivodeship to the south-west, Masovian Voivodeship to the west and north, Podlaskie Voivodeship along a short boundary to the north, and Belarus and Ukraine to the east. The province's population as of 2006 was 2,175,251. It covers an area of . 

The that encompasses Lublin, and approximates Lublin Voivodeship as it was before the Partitions of Poland, is known as "Lubelszczyzna". Provinces centred on Lublin have existed throughout much of Poland's history; for details see the section below on Previous Lublin Voivodeships. 

The region was, before World War II, one of the world's leading centres of Judaism. Before the middle of the 16th century, there were few Jews in the area, concentrated in Lublin, Kazimierz Dolny, and perhaps Chełm; but the founding of new private towns led to a large movement of Jews into the region to develop trade and services. Since these new towns competed with the existing towns for business, there followed a low-intensity, long-lasting feeling of resentment, with failed attempts to limit the Jewish immigration. The Jews tended to settle mostly in the cities and towns, with only individual families setting up businesses in the rural regions; this urban/rural division became another factor feeding resentment of the newly arrived economic competitors. By the middle of the 18th century, Jews were a significant part of the population in Kraśnik, Lubartów and Łęczna. [Q:] What is the location that is the focus of the article?

(CNN) -- The nephew and protege of an imprisoned Mexican drug cartel kingpin pleaded guilty to drug conspiracy charges in a federal court in Brownsville, Texas, on Monday. 

Rafael Cardenas Vela, 38, admitted to being a "plaza boss" in the Gulf Cartel, which prosecutors said was responsible for smuggling thousands of kilograms of cocaine and marijuana into the United States from Mexico. 

Cardenas Vela was arrested by federal agents during a traffic stop in southern Texas in October. 

His uncle, Osiel Cardenas Guillen, led the Matamoros-based Gulf Cartel before he was convicted in 2010 on drug trafficking charges and sentenced to serve 25 years at the supermax prison in Fremont County, Colorado. 

Cardenas Vela fled to the United States in May 2011 to escape an internal power struggle in the cartel after the November 2010 death of another uncle, Ezequiel Cardenas Guillen, according to the U.S. Attorney's office. 

He was still able to control his drug territory through the use of e-mails to key leadership within the cartel, the prosecutors said. 

His operation purchased 70 to 80 kilograms of cocaine each month in southern Mexico, which was then smuggled across the U.S. border in small vehicles about 16 to 20 kilograms at a time, prosecutors said. 

"At the time of Cardenas' arrest, it was discovered he had approximately 500 men equipped and ready to respond to his call," prosecutors said in a news release. 

Cardenas Vela, who is scheduled to be sentenced on June 18, faces a minimum sentence of 10 years in prison and a maximum sentence of life in prison, a fine of up to $10 million and up to five years of supervised release, the government said.  [Q:] What charge is the man in the story facing? [A:] drug conspiracy charges  [Q:] What is the man's name? [A:] Rafael Cardenas Vela  [Q:] What was he bringing into the US?

Buenos Aires ( or ; ) is the capital and most populous city of Argentina. The city is located on the western shore of the estuary of the Río de la Plata, on the South American continent's southeastern coast. "Buenos aires" can be translated as "fair winds" or "good airs", but the first one was the meaning intended by the founders in the 16th century, by the use of the original name "Real de Nuestra Señora Santa María del Buen Ayre". The Greater Buenos Aires conurbation, which also includes several Buenos Aires Province districts, constitutes the fourth-most populous metropolitan area in the Americas, with a population of around 17 million. 

The city of Buenos Aires is neither part of Buenos Aires Province nor the Province's capital; rather, it is an autonomous district. In 1880, after decades of political infighting, Buenos Aires was federalized and removed from Buenos Aires Province. The city limits were enlarged to include the towns of Belgrano and Flores; both are now neighborhoods of the city. The 1994 constitutional amendment granted the city autonomy, hence its formal name: Ciudad Autónoma de Buenos Aires (Autonomous City of Buenos Aires).

(CNN) -- More Arizona and New Mexico residents Wednesday returned to their homes, in some cases to find them intact, in other cases to sift through debris left by a massive wildfire. 

The Wallow fire in east central Arizona is one of 58 large wildfires burning in the United States, from Alaska to Florida, according to the National Interagency Coordination Center. All told, the fires have burned 2,166 square miles or 1.4 million acres -- nearly the size of Delaware. 

The largest of the fires continues to be Arizona's Wallow fire, which has burned 529,825 acres so far, the fire's incident command team announced Wednesday. Officials said it is about 58% contained. 

While residents in Greer, Arizona, and Luna, New Mexico, have been allowed home, evacuation orders remain in effect in other locations. Residents in parts of Apache County, Arizona, also have been told to be prepared to evacuate should. 

CNN iReporter Andrew Pielage, a hotel manager in suburban Phoenix, took photos of burned homes in Greer. 

"As a photographer, I'm here to document what's happening," Pielage said. "Just because the flames are out doesn't mean the fire is done with. I really feel for the people of Greer and their loss." 

Pielage said he was impressed by the perseverance of firefighters and those who live in the community. 

"The photos document both the relentless work the firefighters did to save the homes of Greer as well as, tragically, the ones they could not," he said. 

Greer residents were ordered to evacuate on June 6, two days before the Wallow fire blew through their town of about 200 inhabitants and scorched at least 22 homes and 24 outbuildings. They were allowed home beginning Monday.  [Q:] On what day did people return to their houses? [A:] Wednesday  [Q:] They were from Arizona and where?

France has the world's 6th largest economy by nominal figures and the 10th largest economy by PPP figures. It has the 3rd-largest economy in Europe with the UK in 2nd and Germany in 1st. The OECD is headquartered in Paris, the nation's financial capital. 

The chemical industry is a key sector for France, helping to develop other manufacturing activities and contributing to economic growth. France's tourism industry is a major component of the economy, as France is the most visited destination in the world. Sophia Antipolis is the major technology hub for the economy of France. According to the IMF, in 2013, France was the world's 20th country by GDP per capita with $44,099 per inhabitant. In 2013, France was listed on the United Nations's Human Development Index with 0.884 (very high human development) and 25th on the Corruption Perceptions Index. 

France's economy entered the recession of the late 2000s later and appeared to leave it earlier than most affected economies, only enduring four-quarters of contraction. However, France experienced stagnant growth between 2012 and 2014, with the economy expanding by 0% in 2012, 0.8% in 2013 and 0.2% in 2014, though growth picked up in 2015 with a growth of 0.8% and a growth of 1.1% for 2016, and a forecasted growth of 1.6% for 2017 and 1.8% for 2018, both forecast growth to each being the highest since 2011 (2.1%).

John sent for a doctor because his wife was ill. He called the doctor and made sure they would meet at five. He arrived at the doctor's at twenty to five. He thought, "It's a little bit earlier. I'll wait for a moment. It's good to keep the time." Then he stopped his car in front of the doctor's. He looked around and saw a noisy square not far from here. He went there and sat down on a chair to enjoy the last light of afternoon sun and make himself quiet. He saw some children playing and some women talking to each other happily. Suddenly he heard a girl crying. He came up to her and asked some questions. Then he knew she got lost. John tried to find out her address and took her home. The girl's parents were very thankful. Then John hurried to the doctor's. The doctor said angrily when he saw him, "You're late. Why did you keep me waiting for twenty minutes? " John said nothing but one word--"Sorry! " [Q:] Why was John late for his appointment? [A:] He found a lost child and took her home.  [Q:] Was the square quiet? [A:] no  [Q:] Was the square close to the doctor's office?

(CNN) -- An American man who was held in Aruba for nearly four months in connection with the disappearance of his traveling companion insisted Thursday he had nothing to do with her vanishing but said it will "weigh heavily on me for a very long time." 

"I feel as if a person I cared about, a companion ... has disappeared on my watch," Gary Giordano said on ABC's "Good Morning America" in his first interview since being released from custody in Aruba earlier this week. 

Giordano, 50, had been held in the disappearance of 35-year-old Robyn Gardner of Maryland. Giordano told authorities the two were snorkeling on August 2 when he signaled to Gardner to swim back. When he reached the beach, he told police, Gardner was nowhere to be found and has not been seen since. 

"I only looked back when I hit a rock," he said, according to a transcript of a police interview obtained by CNN. "Before that, I did not look back. I was busy saving my life." 

Aruban judges repeatedly granted requests to extend Giordano's detention, while the investigation continued. But last week, a judge rejected prosecutors' request to hold Giordano, of Gaithersburg, Maryland, for an additional 30 days. He was released Tuesday. 

A three-judge panel of Aruban judges held a hearing Wednesday to review the decision to release Giordano, but upheld it. ABC aired a clip of an emotional Giordano learning of the decision at the airport. "I'd accepted the fact that they were going to keep me from my kids forever," he told reporters in the video.

A little over 26 years ago, Mohammad Reza Najafi started manufacturing auto parts in Iran. 

Today he's an industry leader, supplying roughly three million springs and one million break-pads every year to Iranian auto makers. 

Najafi's success has also earned him seats on the country's Chamber of Commerce and the board of directors of the Iranian Auto Parts Manufacturers Association. It has also made him a leading voice in Iran's efforts to re-energize its struggling economy. 

Like many of his country's business leaders, Najafi has watched the recent negotiations with world powers on Iran's nuclear program with great interest. 

He spoke to CNN's Reza Sayah on this week's Marketplace Middle East, sharing his thoughts on how he sees the talks panning out and the impact they will have on the Iranian economy going forward. 

Reza Sayah (RS): What was your reaction when they couldn't reach a deal (on the nuclear issue)? 

Mohammad Reza Najafi (MRN): As a matter of fact it was a deal but naturally it takes time and we are happy that it is continuing. 

RS: Would you agree that Iran's economy is not going to improve without the sanctions being lifted? 

MRN: It's a very difficult question to answer because at the same time during the sanctions we tried to find our own way to improve ourselves and so on. 

But we are interested to collaborate with them (the international community) so it is an obstacle that should be removed. 

RS: Tell me about Iran's economy today, where does it stand?  [Q:] What type of leader is Mohammad Najafi? [A:] an industry leader  [Q:] What does he supply? [A:] auto parts  [Q:] What is one kind of part he supplies? [A:] springs  [Q:] How many of those each year? [A:] three million  [Q:] What is another part he supplies? [A:] break-pads  [Q:] How many of those? [A:] one million  [Q:] Who does he supply to? [A:] Iranian auto makers  [Q:] How long ago did he start this?

LONDON, England (CNN) -- Who's the greatest driver of all-time? Michael Schumacher? Maybe Alain Prost? Ayrton Senna perhaps? In an exclusive interview with CNN, three-time Formula One world champion, Jackie Stewart had no hesitation in naming his choice for the greatest driver of all-time. 

Three-time F1 champion, Jackie Stewart back in his heyday. 

"My hero, and the man I most respected and probably still do is Juan Manuel Fangio." Stewart told CNN. 

It's not misty-eyed nostalgia for a bygone era that persuades "The Flying Scot," as Stewart became known. And it wasn't just Fangio's tally of world titles that convinced Stewart; it is the manner in which the Argentine legend saw off his rivals. Who do you think is the greatest? 

"Fangio won five world championships almost in a different car every year. He had the dignity, the style and the ability," Stewart explained. 

What's more, as Stewart points out, Fangio didn't start racing in Formula One until he was 39-years-old, and whether driving a Ferrari, Lancia, Maserati or Mercedes, he kept on winning races. 

Though Fangio was the greatest, Stewart rated fellow countryman Jim Clark as the best driver he raced against. 

"His batting average was very good and he didn't race in too many grands prix." Clark -- who was tragically killed racing at Hockenheim in 1968 -- won 25 of his 73 Formula One races. Stewart's record is comparable, winning 27 from 100 starts. 

It's this win to race ratio that really separates the good from the great Stewart believes.  [Q:] What did the man in this story do better than anyone else? [A:] the greatest driver of all-time  [Q:] How old was he when he won the Formula One? [A:] 39  [Q:] Did he use the same auto when he ran? [A:] no  [Q:] Who does he rate as the best? [A:] Juan Manuel Fangio  [Q:] How many times did Jackie Stewart take the cup? [A:] Three  [Q:] What makes the difference between good and great? [A:] win to race ratio  [Q:] How many did Stewart take? [A:] 27 from 100 starts  [Q:] Who died behind the wheel? [A:] Jim Clark  [Q:] When? [A:] 1968  [Q:] Where? [A:] at Hockenheim  [Q:] What were his stats? [A:] he won 25 of his 73 Formula One races
CHAPTER XXIV 

THE DOCTOR'S MISSION 

The letter which Phoebe brought was a long and cordial one, in which Dora begged that Miriam would come and make her a visit of a few days. She said, moreover, that her brother was intending to call on Mr. Haverley and urge him to come to their house as frequently as he could during his sister's visit. Dora said that she would enjoy having Miriam with her so very, very much; and although the life at the dear old farm must be always charming, she believed that Miriam would like a little change, and she would do everything that she could to make the days pass pleasantly. 

There could not have been a more cordial invitation, but its acceptance was considered soberly and without enthusiasm. 

During the past fortnight, there had been no intercourse between the Bannister and Haverley families. Dora, it is true, had written, but her letters had not been called for, and Ralph had not been to her house to inquire about the dog. The reason for this was that, turning over the matter in his mind for a day or two, he thought it well to mention it to Miriam in a casual way, for he perceived that it would be very unwise for him to go to Dora's house without informing his sister and giving her his reasons for the visit. To his surprise, Miriam strenuously opposed his going to the Bannister house on any pretence until Mr. Bannister had called upon him, and showed so much earnest feeling on the subject that he relinquished his intention. He could see for himself that it would not be the proper thing to do; and so he waited, with more impatience on rainy days than others, for Mr. Herbert Bannister to call upon him.  [Q:] What did Dora said that she would enjoy? [A:] having Miriam with her so very, very much;  [Q:] Will this be good for Dora as well? [A:] No  [Q:] What is the name of the chapter? [A:] THE DOCTOR'S MISSION  [Q:] And what was the number? [A:] XXIV  [Q:] What there any intercourse between Bannister and Haverley? [A:] No  [Q:] Who oppose his going to Bannister House? [A:] Miriam  [Q:] Did he tallk to him about this [A:] Yes  [Q:] Has Dora's letter been called for? [A:] No  [Q:] Did Ralph ask for the dot? [A:] No  [Q:] What was the reason for this? [A:] without informing his sister
A psychological identity relates to self-image (one's mental model of oneself), self-esteem, and individuality. Consequently, Weinreich gives the definition "A person's identity is defined as the totality of one's self-construal, in which how one construes oneself in the present expresses the continuity between how one construes oneself as one was in the past and how one construes oneself as one aspires to be in the future"; this allows for definitions of aspects of identity, such as: "One's ethnic identity is defined as that part of the totality of one's self-construal made up of those dimensions that express the continuity between one's construal of past ancestry and one's future aspirations in relation to ethnicity" (Weinreich, 1986a). 

The description or representation of individual and group identity is a central task for psychologists, sociologists and anthropologists and those of other disciplines where "identity" needs to be mapped and defined. How should one describe the identity of another, in ways which encompass both their idiosyncratic qualities and their group memberships or identifications, both of which can shift according to circumstance? Following on from the work of Kelly, Erikson, Tajfel and others Weinreich's Identity Structure Analysis (ISA), is "a structural representation of the individual's existential experience, in which the relationships between self and other agents are organised in relatively stable structures over time … with the emphasis on the socio-cultural milieu in which self relates to other agents and institutions" (Weinreich and Saunderson, (eds) 2003, p1). Using constructs drawn from the salient discourses of the individual, the group and cultural norms, the practical operationalisation of ISA provides a methodology that maps how these are used by the individual, applied across time and milieus by the "situated self" to appraise self and other agents and institutions (for example, resulting in the individual's evaluation of self and significant others and institutions).[citation needed] [Q:] What is the ISA?

CHAPTER XXII 

AFTER THE RUNAWAYS 

"Why, Nat, what do you mean?" demanded Dave. 

"I mean just what I say!" declared the money-lender's son. "This is a frame-up, nothing more! I understand it all now, although I didn't at first." 

"What do you mean by 'a frame-up,' Poole?" demanded Doctor Clay. 

"I mean that they took this magazine and the drawing to the cabin, that is what I mean, Doctor Clay. They found out somehow that my--er--that the wild man was there, and they got up this scheme to make it look as if he had blown up the hotel,--and they did it just to clear their cronies and themselves." 

"Nat, you know that is not true!" exclaimed Roger. "I found the magazine with the drawing on a shelf in the cabin." 

"Yes, that is what you said, but I don't believe it, Roger Morr. I think you put the magazine there yourself--you or Dave Porter." 

"We did nothing of the kind," cried our hero. 

"I think you did--and I think Jason Sparr will think so, too, when he hears the story. It's a frame-up, just to clear yourselves and your cronies," added Nat, with a sneer. 

"Nat, you ought to be----" began Roger, in high anger, when Dave stopped him. Our hero looked at Doctor Clay. 

"What Roger says is the absolute truth, Doctor Clay," said our hero. "He found that magazine on a shelf in the cabin where the wild man was staying, and that drawing and the wording were on it, just as you see. More than that, we can prove that the wild man was around the old shanty where the dynamite was kept, and that he was seen in Oakdale several times."  [Q:] Who is Nat's father? [A:] the money-lender  [Q:] What did the doctor demand to know? [A:] he wanted to know what was meant by frame-up.  [Q:] Where did Roger find the drawing? [A:] on a shelf in the cabin."  [Q:] What was the wild scheme? [A:] they took this magazine and the drawing  [Q:] What kind of house was the magazine found in? [A:] cabin  [Q:] What type of person was found around the dynamite? [A:] the wild man  [Q:] Where were the explosives stored? [A:] old shanty  [Q:] Was the wild man seen more than once? [A:] Yes  [Q:] How many times was he observed? [A:] several times  [Q:] In what city? [A:] Oakdale
Diwali is perhaps the most well--known of the Hindu festivals. It is celebrated by Hindus in India and abroad. It is often called the Festival of Lights. For Hindus, Diwli is very important and it is also very exciting time for them. Normally , this holiday is celebrated in October or November and it falls on a different date each year. This year , it will be celebrated on October23. Diwali is usually celebrated for 5 days. To prepare for Diwali, Hindus spend several weeks cleaning their homes and preparing special food in order to welcome Laskhmi, the goodness of wealth into their lives. They will open the windows of their homes during this time to make sure that she can enter their home. One of other traditions of Dawali is to light up oil lamp in the homes. The oil lamps are used to make the goddess of wealth enter the homes. Hindus believe that she will not enter a home that is not lit up. During Diwali, the children in India do not have to go to school. They share gifts with one another and prepare special holiday meals to celebrate this event. Fireworks are also a big part of the Diwali festival. They are used to scare away bad spirits. [Q:] How do people get ready for Diwali?

Molecular biology concerns the molecular basis of biological activity between biomolecules in the various systems of a cell, including the interactions between DNA, RNA, and proteins and their biosynthesis, as well as the regulation of these interactions. Writing in "Nature" in 1961, William Astbury described molecular biology as: 

Researchers in molecular biology use specific techniques native to molecular biology but increasingly combine these with techniques and ideas from genetics and biochemistry. There is not a defined line between these disciplines. The figure to the right is a schematic that depicts one possible view of the relationships between the fields: 

Much of molecular biology is quantitative, and recently much work has been done at its interface with computer science in bioinformatics and computational biology. In the early 2000s, the study of gene structure and function, molecular genetics, has been among the most prominent sub-fields of molecular biology. Increasingly many other areas of biology focus on molecules, either directly studying interactions in their own right such as in cell biology and developmental biology, or indirectly, where molecular techniques are used to infer historical attributes of populations or species, as in fields in evolutionary biology such as population genetics and phylogenetics. There is also a long tradition of studying biomolecules "from the ground up" in biophysics. [Q:] what is the article about? [A:] Molecular biology  [Q:] is it quantitative?

Three little kids lived in a great big house with a great big cat and many places for a great big cat to hide. Their great big cat was named Cowboy. And Cowboy was not a very nice cat. Cowboy liked to bite and chew and scratch a great many things. When Cowboy was happy, which was not very often, Cowboy liked to bite in to a blanket or soft toy and carry it around in his mouth. When Cowboy was hungry he liked to bite bright red tomatoes and suck out all the juice and seeds. And when Cowboy was feeling mean he liked to hide. Cowboy would hide, curled up tight in a ball under a blanket or behind a corner and wait for one of the little kids to pass by. When they did pass by Cowboy would jump at their feet and try to bite and scratch them. He did not know that what he was doing was not very nice. Cowboy was only a cat. A great big cat that did not know any better. [Q:] What kind of pet did the kids have? [A:] cat  [Q:] What type of food the did cat like to eat? [A:] tomatoes  [Q:] What was the cat's name?

Years ago, when I started looking for my first job, wise advisers advised, "Barbara, be enthusiastic ! Enthusiasm will take you further than any amount of experience." How right they were! 

"Nothing great was ever done without enthusiasm," wrote Ralph Waldo Emerson. It is the paste that helps you hang in there when the things get tough. It is the inner voice that tells you, "I can do it!" when others shout, "No, you can't!" It took years and years for the early work of Barbara McClintock, a geneticist who won the 1983 Nobel Prize in medicine, to be generally accepted. Yet she didn't stop working on her experiments. 

We are all born with wide-eyed, enthusiastic wonder and it is the childlike wonder that gives enthusiastic people such youthful air, whatever their age. At 90, cellist Pablo Casals would start his day by playing the cello . As the music flowed through his fingers, his shoulders would straighten and joy would reappear in his eyes. As writer and poet Samuel Ullman once worte, "Years wrinkle the skin, but to give up enthusiasm wrinkles the soul." 

Enthusiastic people also love what they do, not considering money or title or power. Patricia Mellratl, a retired director of the Missouri Rpertory Theater in Kansas City, was once asked where she got her enthusiasm. She replied, "My father, long ago, told me, 'I never made any money until I stopped working for it.'" 

We can't afford to waste tears on "might-have-been". We need to turn the tears into sweat as we go after "what-can-be". We need to live each moment whole-heartedly, with all our senses finding pleasure in the sweet of a backyard garden, the simple picture of a six-year-old, and the beauty of a rainbow.

CHAPTER XVII 

A QUEER CAPTAIN 

"You saw Dan Baxter, here in Pittsburg?" ejaculated Dick. 

"Dat's it." 

"You are sure you were not mistaken, Aleck? I thought that rascal was miles and miles away." 

"Dat's jess wot I dun been thinkin' too. But it was Dan Baxter, suah. I knows him too well to make any mistake about his ugly face." 

"Where was he?" 

"Dat's de alarmin' part ob it, Massah Dick. Yo' know yo' tole me to find de houseboat." 

"Yes." 

"Well, I found de boat wid dat dar Cap'n Starr on board, an' we made all dem 'rangements wot you spoke about. Den I started to leave de boat.

"Did you go after him?" 

"Yes, but I couldn't cotch him nohow. Dar was big piles ob boxes an' barrels on de dock and he got away befo' I know wot I was at. I hunted an' hunted, but I couldn't git on his track."

Alan worked in an office in the city. He worked very hard and really looked forward to his holiday. He usually went to the seaside, but one year he saw an ad. in a newspaper "Enjoy country life. Spend a few weeks at William Farm. Good food, fresh air, horse riding, walking, fishing..." 

"This sounds like a good idea." he thought, I'll spend a month at William Farm. I'll go horse riding, walking and fishing. It'll be different from the seaside." Four days later, he returned home. 

"What's wrong with William Farm?" his friend Jack asked him, "Didn't you enjoy country life?" 

"Country life was fine," Alan said, "But there was another problem." 

"Oh, what problem?" 

"Well, the first day I was there, a sheep died, and we had roast mutton for dinner." 

"Fresh meat is the best." 

"I know, but on the second day a cow died, and we had roast beef for dinner." 

"Lucky you!" 

"You don't understand," Alan said, "On the third day a pig died and we had roast pork for dinner."

The kitchen comes alive at night in the Sanderson house. Vegetables, fruit, bread, and more come out to play. The knives and forks dance on the tables. There are games and prizes. Milk is used for swimming races. The cereal often wins those. Fruit gets used as balls in some games. Blueberries scream in joy as they are kicked into soccer goals in games between the spoons and vegetables like celery and carrots. Their cousins, the raspberries, like to watch the games. Everyone has a great time and laughs. They are happy to come out and be friends. If someone, like little John or his sister Kim, comes down to get water, they all hide until they leave. The father, Ryan, sometimes wakes up and thinks he hears something downstairs. His wife, Susan, tells him he needs to go back to bed. She tells him he is imagining things. He is not.

A440 or A4 (also known as the Stuttgart pitch), which has a frequency of 440 Hz, is the musical note of A above middle C and serves as a general tuning standard for musical pitch. 

The International Organization for Standardization classify it as ISO 16. Prior to the standardization on 440 Hz, other frequencies were standardised upon. Although not universally accepted, it serves as the audio frequency reference for the calibration of acoustic equipment and the tuning of pianos, violins, and other musical instruments. 

Prior to the standardization on 440 Hz, many countries and organizations followed the French standard since the 1860s of 435 Hz, which had also been the Austrian government's 1885 recommendation. Johann Heinrich Scheibler recommended A440 as a standard in 1834 after inventing the "tonometer" to measure pitch, and it was approved by the the same year. 

The American music industry reached an informal standard of 440 Hz in 1926, and some began using it in instrument manufacturing. In 1936 the American Standards Association recommended that the A above middle C be tuned to 440 Hz. This standard was taken up by the International Organization for Standardization in 1955 (reaffirmed by them in 1975) as ISO 16. Although not universally accepted, since then it has served as the audio frequency reference for the calibration of acoustic equipment and the tuning of pianos, violins, and other musical instruments. [Q:] What entity standardized A4 on 440 Hertz? [A:] International Organization for Standardization  [Q:] What do they classify it as? [A:] ISO 16  [Q:] Was A4 always standardized at 440 Hertz?

[A:] A440  [Q:] Or what else? [A:] Stuttgart pitch  [Q:] What note is it? [A:] A above middle C  [Q:] In the 1920s, did the American music companies have A4 as an official standard? [A:] no  [Q:] Who made a recommendation in 1936? [A:] the American Standards Association  [Q:] What did they recommend? [A:] that the A above middle C be tuned to 440 Hz.  [Q:] What happened in 1955?

The dog, called Prince, was an intelligent animal and a slave to Williams. From morning till night, he had a number of clear duties, for which Williams had patiently trained him and, like a good pupil, Prince lived for the chance to prove his abilities. When Williams wanted to put on his boots, he would murmur. "Boots" and within seconds the dog would drop them at his feet. At nine every morning Prince ran off to the general store in the village, returning shortly not only with Williams' daily paper but with a packet of Williams' favorite tobacco. A trained gun-dog, Prince had a large soft mouth specially evolved (;) for the sake of carrying hunted creatures, so the paper and tobacco came to no harm, never even showing a tooth mark. 

Williams was an engine driver, and he had to work at irregular times -- "days", "late days", or "nights". Over the years Prince got to know these periods of work and rest, and knew when his master would leave the house and return and _ If Williams overslept, Prince barked at the bedroom door until he woke. On his return, Williams' slippers were brought to him, the paper and tobacco too. 

A curious thing happened to Williams during the snow and ice of last winter. One evening he slipped and fell on the icy pavement somewhere between the village and his home. He was so badly shaken that he stayed in bed for three days; and not until he got up and dressed again did he discover that he had lost his wallet containing over fifty pounds. The house was turned upside down in the search, but the wallet was not found. However, two days later, Prince dropped the wallet into Williams' hand.
